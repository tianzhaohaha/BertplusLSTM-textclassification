number of infected cases is increasing every day and have already spread to several European countries In Portugal the first two suspicions were not confirmed but the alert is global and the general panic Global health authorities have alerted citizens to take measures to prevent the spread of the virus the rate of spread of which is still unknown The use of masks is one of them mainly in China where they were already daily used due to the high signs of pollution However excessive demand from the coronavirus has led to the stock of masks depleting somewhat around the world This has led some people toimprovise using improbable objects such a s brassieres plastic bags containers and even lettuce leaves and orange peels to cover the airway But is this a good idea Can the mask protect from

there are three types of mask available on the market The first are those of reusable cloth which became a fashion icon in Asia sold with the most diverse colors and patterns There is also the so called surgical mask known to be used by doctors and nurses on the operating table Its made of paper and other fibers and its light and thin They are not reusable and should therefore be discarded after first use Finally there are still the most resistant masks used by health professionals in hospitals where there are outbreaks or infections and also by construction workers in the works to protect themselves from dust and undesirable materials But which of these three will be the best way to protect ourselves from the coronavirus Studies have argued that the response is not watertight and that it may vary depending on how the virus propagates which in the case of the Chinese deadly virus is still unknown This is because some\n","------------------------------\n","Tokens :
