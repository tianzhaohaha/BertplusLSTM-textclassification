Hi, \n In today\u2019s bulletin:  \n Alarm grows in Asia over a Covid-19 rebound as imported cases rise,\u00a0 China\u2019s outreach to Europe in the spotlight, religious gatherings in the region raise concern, a Thai ninja to fight infections, and more. \n Reading this on the web or know someone who might enjoy receiving Asian Insider? Our sign-up page is here. \n  \n Worries over coronavirus infections coming in from abroad seemed of\u00a0growing concern as imported cases of infections grew and countries considered further travel restrictions.\u00a0 \n China reported today that while there were no new infections in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, imported cases surged by a record and accounted for all of the new confirmed cases in mainland China. In another move, the port of Fuzhou in eastern China\u00a0began restricting vessels arriving from nine countries in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus by visiting ships and their crew.\u00a0 \n The Philippines announced today it is stopping the issuance of visas to foreigners to contain the outbreak. \n Singapore, on Wednesday, announced that all Singaporeans and residents returning to the country will have to serve a 14-day isolation period. This came on a day when the number of new cases spiralled to 47, an all-time high. Of these, 33 cases were imported and of them 30 involved Singapore residents returning from abroad. \n Two days ago, India shut down the Taj Mahal and other popular tourist locations and expanded its travel and visa restrictions to include travellers from the European Union, Turkey and the United Kingdom. In Japan, the revelry was missing as the country's famed cherry blossom season, that usually attracts visitors from around the world, was officially declared as having started on March 14. \n Also read:\u00a0 \n Airfares soar 174% as Chinese flee Europe\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n What is a stay-home notice, and what should you do if you are affected?\u00a0 \n New evidence shows young people are falling seriously ill \n  \n China is reaching out to European countries to share its knowledge and expertise on Covid-19.

China's aid and assistance comes at a time of growing concern as Europe becomes the new epicentre of Covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump riled China by insisting the virus originated in China and there was nothing wrong in calling it a \"Chinese virus\". And in a surprising turn of events, the adviser to the Hong Kong government said that it was okay to refer to the virus as the \"Wuhan coronavirus\" in a column.

The company said passengers were tested regularly on board and Cambodia also tested 20 people once it docked, but not the woman who contracted the virus. \n Ms Raina MacIntyre, head of the Biosecurity Research Program at Australia's University of New South Wales, said it was well known the coronavirus can be infectious even if a patient has no symptoms. \n \"The Japanese tested over 500 of their first evacuees from Wuhan, whether they were symptomatic or not, and five out of eight positive tests were in asymptomatic people,\" Ms MacIntyre said. \"So, in a high risk setting, it would be important to check for infection in everyone.\" \n Holland America said it is working with health officials in Malaysia and Cambodia and experts in the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). \n Worries about the new virus have mounted even though it is believed to kill only around 1 per cent of people it infects, because of fears that with no natural immunity among the world's population, it could spread to infect millions if unchecked. \n The websites of both the CDC and WHO give an estimated incubation period for the virus of up to 14 days. \n Mr Adam Kamradt-Scott, infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said a Chinese study of 1,099 patients indicated the incubation period could be as much as 24 days, but most people exhibited symptoms within three days. \n Anyone potentially exposed to the virus should self-isolate and notify health authorities if they start to exhibit symptoms, he said. \n \"We need people to be willing to come forward and not fear persecution or discrimination, as that will only serve to aid the virus\u2019 spread.\" \n In Japan, another Carnival cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, has been quarantined since arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb 3.

Tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, director general of IAEA, stressed: \"this does not mean that it cannot be completed at other times.\".\nIt was the second day of the meeting and the decision was not unanimous. The committee was divided: half of the 16 experts requested this special measure, while the other half requested the opposite. \"In view of the limited number of infections outside China, the number of cases (more than 600 cases) and their severity (18 deaths), and considering the efforts of the Chinese authorities to curb the virus, it is too early for us to make a decision,\" he said at a press conference of Didier haussin in Geneva.

Previously, who has taken this action only five times: in the face of influenza A (H1N1) (2009), Ebola virus in West Africa (2014) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2019), polio (2014) and Zika virus (2016).\nThe international state of emergency is a measure aimed at curbing the spread of disease. According to the species, characteristics and evolution law of pathogenic bacteria, corresponding control measures were taken. For example, in the case of polio, a well-known disease, the main recommendation of who is to ensure that all residents or those who will live in Iraq (the site of the outbreak) can receive an oral or intramuscular dose of polio vaccine. The idea is to prevent travelers from becoming communicators of the virus. Restricting the transit of persons and goods is another possible measure. Ghebreyesus stressed that these measures are not recommended in China today, except for the measures taken by local authorities on their own initiative rather than the recommendations of who.\nThe two most similar diseases known are SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). The first one also appeared in China in 2002. At that time, about 8000 people were infected, of which about 10 per cent died. In 2012, SRM broke out in Saudi Arabia, and 35% of the affected people died. It is too early to draw a conclusion on the new virus cases in Wuhan, but so far, the mortality rate is about 3%.

(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n* GRAPHIC: Coking coal vs spot gold: tmsnrt.rs/2QlzRMZ\nBy Clyde Russell\nLAUNCESTON, Australia, March 17 (Reuters) - Amid carnage in the oil markets, and sharp losses for other commodities such as copper, you may be tempted to think gold is the best option for a positive return. But coal beats the metal.\nCoal\u2019s image is increasingly that of a pariah fuel, demonised by environmentalists and shunned by investors wary of its role in climate change.\nBut one of the top performing commodities this year is coking coal, the higher-quality fuel used to make steel.\nCoking coal futures on the Singapore Exchange, which mirror The Steel Index price for Australian free-on-board cargoes, ended at $159.98 a tonne on Monday, up 17.7% since the end of last year.\nIn contrast, spot gold ended at $1,513.91 an ounce on Monday, down 0.2% from end-2019, with the loss extending in Asian trade on Tuesday to around 1.5%.\nAnd it\u2019s not just coking coal. Even thermal coal, used mainly in power plants, is looking fairly solid.\nThe weekly index price for thermal coal at Australia\u2019s Newcastle port, as assessed by commodity price reporting agency Argus, was $64.87 a tonne in the week ended March 13, virtually unchanged from the $64.85 that prevailed at the end of 2019.\nLower-quality Indonesian coal with a energy value of 4,200 kilocalories per kg was at $32.77 a tonne, down 3.1% from the end of last year.\nTo put that into perspective, global benchmark Brent crude futures dropped 54.5% from the end of last year to their close of $30.05 a barrel on Monday.\nCrude has been pummelled by a supply war breaking out between top exporter Saudi Arabia and number two Russia, after the breakdown of the agreement between OPEC and its allies to curb output to bolster prices.\nOil markets have also been hit by a demand shock, with the coronavirus pandemic spreading around the world likely to knock out several million barrels per day of consumption as the skies are emptied of planes and people stay home.\nOther commodities are also suffering, with spot Asian liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes down 35.3% from the end of last year, and London copper contracts down 14.3% over the same period.\nSo, why have both coking and thermal coal managed to stand against the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, spreading around the world since then and resulting in the lockdown of cities and countries and impinging on transportation links?\nThe coronavirus itself is part of the answer, as one of China\u2019s main sources of coking coal, neighbouring Mongolia, closed its borders in February, cutting off up to 50% of China\u2019s supplies.\nSeasonal wet weather in Australia\u2019s Queensland state, the source of the bulk of exports, also crimped available cargoes and led to price increases. Australia provides more than half of the global volume of coking coal exports.\nWhile China\u2019s economy was largely shut down for much of February as part of efforts to contain the virus, it has since re-started and coking coal demand is ramping up.\nThe Mongolian border has also reopened, but Queensland is still having weather disruptions, keeping coking coal prices resilient.\nHopes that Beijing will boost stimulus measures to bolster the economy have also supported coking coal prices, as well as those for iron ore.\nBenchmark 62% iron ore MT-IO-QIN62=ARG, as assessed by Argus, ended at $90.30 a tonne on Monday, little changed from $90.15 on the last trading day of 2019.\nThermal coal also benefited from the coronavirus as Chinese mines were either idled or working at reduced rates, boosting demand for imports of the fuel.\nWith China\u2019s mines returning to normal, there may be an easing in demand for imported cargoes, but the imports are still competitive with domestic prices, meaning traders have a profit incentive to buy from top thermal coal exporter Indonesia and number two Australia.\nPerhaps coking and thermal coal, as well as iron ore, provide an optimistic note that commodity prices can recover once the coronavirus is contained.

Merkel suffered on his skin (in fact, it was without contact). Will we s e e fewer handshakes, kisses and hugs? Maybe\nIn Italy, the Guardian continues, the special Commissioner for the fight against the virus suggested that Italians should be \"a little less expansive\". In France it was Olivier Veran, the Minister of Health, who advised the people to kiss and hug less. In the United Kingdom it has not yet com e this far, according to this diary, but Paul Cosford, a professor and medical director emeritus of Public Health England, a department of the British Ministry of Health, has admitted that, although not against handshakes, the inevitable day will come: to reduce social contact.\nBut the most disturbing text in \"The Guardian\" is in the paragraph in which the medical officer at Anglia Ruskin University says, \"Science says that handshakes are gross.\" Nicky Milner reveals that our hands carry on average 3200 bacteria of 150 different species. Plus, on average we give 15 thousand handshakes during our lifetime.\nSylvie Briand, the director for WHO's pandemic diseases, said it was time to adapt to Covid-19. What?

There is another way: touch with your foot.\nWhat does the DGS recommend?\n", "label": 1, "id": 1810}, {"content": "No need to curse bats. Dracula's companion, bloodsucking night warmers, and now also dangerous virus seekers, who are to blame for the Coronavirus outbreak in China. The image of the bats has been further cracked when genetic analysis of the new pathogen with the provisional name 2019-nCoV revealed: it is related to a virus that treats Hufeisennasen (The Lancet: Lu et al. 2020) to 88 percent. Bats, flying dogs and their relatives are particularly popular in Germany. Many people have been campaigning for decades for the protection of the 25-species native to us, almost a third of which are considered endangered or threatened with extinction.\nIt is not until the current coronavirus epidemic that bats are held accountable when an animal-borne pathogen spreads among humans. Fleas are considered to be a popular reservoir for viruses, i.e. the viruses are dormant in them and waiting for their chance to spread across species boundaries. When the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-CoV) also caused the first outbreak of the Coronavirus (Mers-CoV) in the year 2012 on the Arabian Peninsula, it was dromedars that transmitted the new pathogen to humans. But bats must have infected the camels.\nThe Nipah virus, which affected pig farmers for the first time in Malaysia, can also be traced back to bats: the farmers were infected by their pigs, who had eaten fruit again, on which feces and urine were glued by flying dogs. It is precisely this interplay of different species as hosts of viruses that divides scientists into at least two camps: some stress that the viruses originated from bats. The others focus on the fact that it was camels and pigs that transmitted the diseases to humans. Ultimately, the causal question remains one of the interpretations: is the type of causator of an epidemic that originally harbored the virus? Or the one who passed it on to humans?\nMost viruses have hosts beyond species boundaries. They are constantly changing, exchanging heritage among themselves and learning new things: Thus, a pathogen that first only affects birds can, through mutations, acquire the ability to enter human cells, so an animal disease becomes a disease for humans. When that happens, scientists talk about zoonosis. The further mankind enters the habitat of animals, the higher the likelihood that new zoonoses will emerge. People blush forests, hunt and eat wild animals or seek adventure in the wilderness as tourists. Rather, they come into contact with infected animals and stick to them. Similarly, in a wildlife market in Wuhan, the epidemic with the new Coronavirus may have begun.\nWhen the inheritance of the new pathogen was sequenced a few weeks after the outbreak, it turned out to be 88 percent equal to the two Coronavirus species that were first found in bats in 2018. \"It is clear that this pathogen originated from the bat,\" says Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine.\n\"I don't want to deny that the virus could have come from a bat at any time,\" says renowned bat researcher Paul Racey from Aberdeen University in Scotland. But he is a representative of the second group of researchers, who seems to be much more relevant to a completely different question: What kind of animal has the new virus ultimately transmitted to humans?\nBats are an order of mammals that, in the classical nomenclature, divide into the subordinates of flying dogs (Megachiroptera) and bats (Microchiroptera).\nRecent genetic analyses have shown, however, that the hoof-nosed species originally attributed to bats are more closely related to flying dogs. This is why zoologists nowadays distinguish bats from a new subsection, the yinterochiroptera: in turn, they include flying dogs and horseshoe-nosed (Rhinolophoidea).\nBats are usually nocturnal and can be spatially oriented by ultrasound. Most bats are smaller than flying dogs and feed on\nof insects. Flying dogs are called that because their head looks like a dog's. They are found mainly in the tropics and subtropes, where they feed mainly on fruit or nectar. In contrast to bats, flying dogs tend to orient themselves optically rather than over echo waves. Huffin-like species owe their name to a small patch of skin between the upper lip and the forehead, which is shaped like a Hufeisen. They feed, like bats, mainly on insects.\nBats are suspected to be the natural host of various viruses that can also make people sick: Ebola, Nipah, Hendra and Marburg as well as the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). In addition, researchers found similarities between the new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and two virus strains found in bats.\nFor Racey, there would be clear evidence that the pathogen has passed directly from a bat or a flying dog to humans only if researchers could prove to a bat that it eliminates 2019-nCoV directly, so it actually spreads the virus. There is no such proof so far. The fact that two strands of viruses are similar in their heritage is not enough for bat researchers to blame the bats with their more than 1.400-known species alone for a new outbreak. After the rodents, they formed the most species-rich order of mammals, and were often targeted because of their large spread.\nAccording to Racey, it may be good that the new Coronavirus has long since passed from one bat to another. This intermediary could then have passed the agent on to humans, for example at the wildlife and fish market in Wuhan. What kind of animal this could be is still unclear. \"We don't know which animals were on the market,\" Racey says. Also Virologist Schmidt-Chanasit does not rule out that there was an intermediate host, i.e. animal species between bats and humans. But it is clear to him: the bat is the origin of the new Coronavirus. And whoever is the unknown landlord is being researched intensively.\nBut that is precisely what zoologists criticise: that all zoonoses are always researched until the bat appears at the origin of the infection chain. This is because not all potential species carrying viruses would be investigated equally intensively, says Merlin Tuttle, bat shooters and zoologists from the USA. Bats are easy to catch, Tuttle knows from his own experience: you set a trap at the entrance of a cave and wait, until the animals fly in. \"It would be much harder to catch thirty cobras than thirty bats,\" says the researcher. The virologist Schmidt-Chanasit understands the argument, but says that you can argue the whole thing in the other direction: \"If you catch more bats, you might find a virus that matches the new Coronavirus to 99 percent.\"\nWhether Nipah, Sars or Mers: Bats are considered to be the original hearth for many viruses that can infect humans (trends in microbiology: Brook & Dobson, 2015). Often they carry the pathogens in the body without getting sick themselves. Why this is so, there are different theories about it: many have something to do with bats consuming extremely much energy while flying, which could also affect their immune system. It could, for example, result in their bodyguards not fighting viruses with full force but tolerating them by various means. This would also explain why the animals themselves do not get sick but can pass on the pathogens (Emerging Infectious Diseases: O'Shea et al., 2014). However, the exact mechanism has not yet been clarified.\nIt is at least clear that bats and flying dogs are \"an incredibly rich group of mammals\", says Fabian Leendertz, who is researching pathogenic microorganisms at the Robert Koch Institute of Epidemiology. And the more species there are, the higher the likelihood that the animals will host a greater variety of microbes. There are also very large bat populations that are a perfect reservoir for viruses. Individual species of flying dogs or bats do not necessarily have to be more mature than other animals. Your species line\nhtum may make it a common carrier. Researchers from the EcoHealth Alliance, a private research facility in New York, investigated 754 mammalian species and found that, overall, bats harbour more zoonotic viruses than any other mammalian species investigated (Nature: Olival et al., 2017).\nInter-owner or co-owner: the spread of the viruses is not the fault of the bat anyway. For nature does not know the principle of guilt. Seeing them as the cause may be right on the principle of causality, but it is too short-sighted. Voigt says, instead of pointing the finger at animals at any new pathogen emerging among humans, people should rather rethink their own behaviour towards wild animals. Wildlife plays a major role in transmitting viruses from animals to humans. Many zoonotic outbreaks, however, are not even due to people hunting large wild animals like monkeys in the jungle, Leendertz says. Instead, they are targeting so-called cultural successors, for example rats, bats and flying dogs that are in the vicinity of human habitations. At the same time, it is difficult to condemn such hunting practices on a global scale: hunting is an ancient tradition in many regions and is regarded as an important source of food. One problem is also the markets where people buy and sell wild animals. There, dead and living animals are offered in the narrowest space, people rush through the small alleys, everything mixes and mixes: a perfect place for a virus to spread quickly.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than the Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules\nYou should wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nFledermaus researchers such as Racey and Tuttle fear that branding the flying dogs and bats as viral vectors will further worsen the relationship between them and humans. \"If bats are considered to be the cause of Ebola and other viruses, no one will accept a bat in their own garden anymore,\" says Tuttle. Recently he was called by the owner of an apartment complex: a bat flew into one of the apartments, the inhabitants now fear that they have infected the animal with a disease. \"The current media reports about the connection between the Coronavirus and bats have certainly fuelled the story,\" says Tuttle. Although Hufeisennasen may have played a role in the case of the new Coronavirus: here in Europe it is very unlikely that people will infect bats with a dangerous virus, says Christian Voigt, who is researching bats at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research. In Europe, bats could only transmit rabies. But this risk is also rather small: according to the Robert Koch Institute, the last rabies-related rabies-related case in Europe 2002 occurred in Scotland.\nThroughout the discussion about animals as vectors of disease, it is often forgotten how important they are to agriculture and nature worldwide, and what role they play in different ecosystems worldwide. Some flying dogs, but also few bats, pollinate just like bees and other useful crops. As insect eaters, our native bat species keep the pests in check. But not a few are now threatened with extinction. In this situation, the batsmen from the USA and Europe fear that an image of virus-spreading could further harm the animals: not only because then perhaps fewer people will donate for the protection of these animals than for sweet pandas or seal babies. It is also because they fear that bats could be systematically fought like rats or pigeons in the city. With all the excitement surrounding the origin of the new Coronavirus, the world should not lose sight of the global dramatic species death. Well, cursing bats doesn't protect you from any disease.\n", "label": 1, "id": 1811}, {"content": "IPL 2020: BCCI invites all 8 franchises to decide fate of 13th edition amid coronavirus pandemic.

SIHANOUKVILLE (Cambodia) \u2014 When Cambodia\u2019s prime minister greeted passengers on a cruise ship amid a coronavirus scare on Valentine\u2019s Day, embraces were the order of the day. Protective masks were not. \n Not only did Prime Minister Hun Sen not wear one, assured that the ship was virus-free, his bodyguards ordered people who had donned masks to take them off. The next day, the US ambassador to Cambodia, Mr W. Patrick Murphy, who brought his own family to greet the passengers streaming off the ship, also went maskless. \n \u201cWe are very, very grateful that Cambodia has opened literally its ports and doors to people in need,\u201d Mr Murphy said. \n But after hundreds of passengers had disembarked, one later tested positive for the coronavirus, known as Covid-19. Now, health officials worry that what Cambodia opened its doors to was the outbreak, and that the world may pay a price as passengers from the cruse ship Westerdam stream home. \n Before the Westerdam docked in Sihanoukville, fearful governments in other countries had turned the ship away at five ports of call even though the cruise operator, Holland America, assured officials that the ship\u2019s passengers had been carefully screened. \n Mr Hun Sen\u2019s decision to allow it entry appeared to be a political calculus as much as anything else. The region\u2019s longest-serving ruler and a close ally of China, he is known for his survival skills. \n But Mr Hun Sen\u2019s critics worry that the aging autocrat might have acted rashly. \n \u201cOf course, he had to do the dictator thing: photo op, roses, exploit this for its maximum value,\u201d said Mr Sophal Ear, an expert in Cambodian politics at Occidental College. \u201cWhatever is in the best interest of Cambodians is completely irrelevant to him.\u201d \n It is too early to tell whether the decision to let hundreds of passengers from the Westerdam fly off has the makings of an epidemiological disaster. Cambodian health authorities said that 409 of the 2,257 passengers and crew had left Cambodia for their homes scattered across the globe. The rest remain in hotels in Phnom Penh, the capital, or on the ship. \n But deficiencies in screening for the coronavirus aboard the ship, along with continued complacency about the epidemic in Cambodia, are raising fears this small Southeast Asian nation could prove to be a surprising vector of transmission for a virus that has already killed more than 1,700 people, mostly in China, the epicenter of the outbreak. \n Many health experts urge people who have been in contact with coronavirus patients to self-quarantine for 14 days, lest they add another spoke to the contagion network. \n But on Monday (Feb 17), Mr Hun Sen directed officials in Phnom Penh to treat passengers from the Westerdam to a sightseeing jaunt. \n \u201cTo tour the city is better than staying in rooms or at the hotel feeling bored or scared,\u201d said a post on Mr Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook page. \n The lack of urgency in Cambodia, where officials milled around the ship Monday without protection, points to the obstacles in trying to contain a virus that experts warn is spreading faster than Sars (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) or Mers, (Middle East respiratory syndrome). \n \u201cThis is influenza-like transmission,\u201d said Mr Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to stop the wind.\u201d \n Last week, when the Westerdam docked in Sihanoukville, the Cambodian government and the cruise operator deemed the vessel virus-free. \n The declaration was at a minimum premature. \n Only 20 people out of the 2,257 onboard were tested for the virus before disembarking, and that was because they had reported themselves to ship medical staff with various ailments. \n The woman who twice tested positive after travelling on to Malaysia, an 83-year-old American, was not among those 20, Holland America said. \n Health monitoring for the rest of the passengers was limited to a handful of temperature checks conducted with infrared thermometers, passengers said. In a statement, Holland America said that during one of those screenings, not a single person on board recorded an elevated temperature. \n On Monday, an announcement broadcast to passengers remaining on the Westerdam warned that they should avoid the ship\u2019s hot deck and return to their air-conditioned rooms to avoid falsely high temperature readings. \n Some health experts have questioned the efficacy\nof infrared thermometers, also known as temperature guns, saying they measure the heat emanating from the surface of the body, rather than core body temperature. \n Various environmental factors can distort thermometer gun reading, said Mr Gary Strahan, who runs a small infrared device company in Texas. \n \u201cIn Cambodia, you have warmer background temperatures,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could impact the measurement. That\u2019s the issue with any noncontact thermometer.\u201d \n Even if temperatures are accurately gauged, people may be taking medication that lower their temperature, like some arthritis drugs. \n And in any case, people who are asymptomatic can still pass on the coronavirus, scientists have found. \n \u201cA person who does not present as feverish is not necessarily uninfected with a disease or a virus,\u201d said Mr Jim Seffrin, an expert on infrared devices at the Infraspection Institute in New Jersey. \n In the wake of the positive test in Malaysia, Cambodian health officials said they would be relying on a domestic lab to test all passengers and crew members still in the country for the coronavirus. \n On Monday evening, passengers celebrated news from Cambodian health officials that a first batch of 406 people in Phnom Penh had tested negative, although there was no certainty they would not later test positive. \n \u201cPeople on the ship are very grateful to the people of Cambodia,\u201d said Ms Tammie Graves, an American from Kansas. \u201cI was a bit worried that they might be afraid of us, even at the hotel, but it hasn\u2019t been like that at all.\u201d \n On Monday afternoon, more than 100 Westerdam passengers took up Mr Hun Sen\u2019s offer of a capital tour, piling in buses to see the royal palace and other sites. \n In pictures of the excursion, posted on a government-linked website, only one person can be seen wearing a mask. \n Despite cases of coronavirus popping up in Southeast Asia, Hun Sen has campaigned against masks, arguing that they are better at spreading fear than stopping germs. At a news conference last month, he announced that he would kick out anyone who dared wear a mask. \n Even as other governments instituted China travel bans that angered Beijing, Mr Hun Sen travelled to the Chinese capital and met with Mr Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, in another photo op. \n And as other countries organised airlifts of people trapped in Wuhan, the city where the virus is believed to have originated, Mr Hun Sen said he would not ferry Cambodian students home because they should be \u201cjoining with Chinese to fight this disease.\u201d \n The sense of solidarity makes sense in a country heavily dependent on China for its fortunes, after having turned its back on a West that was demanding progress in human rights in return for aid and investment. \n A torrent of Chinese cash has remade Cambodia, nowhere more so than in Sihanoukville, a once sleepy beach town that is now a sprawling construction site of gilded casinos and towering residential blocks. More than 90 per cent of businesses in the city are now Chinese owned. \n On Monday, Ms Oeun Yen, a masseuse, worried about the massages she had given three female passengers from the Westerdam before the virus case was confirmed by Malaysia. She was not afraid at first, she said, because the prime minister had assured people all was fine. \n \u201cNow I am more concerned,\u201d she said. \n In a country where Mr Hun Sen has dissolved the biggest opposition party and political assassination is not uncommon, such mild concern is as much as many ordinary residents are willing to muster. \n But there is also widespread skepticism of the government\u2019s contention that only one person in Cambodia has tested positive for coronavirus, a Chinese citizen who has since returned home. \n \u201cThere is a natural lack of credibility and trust associated with the Cambodian government,\u201d said Mr Ou Virak, a human-rights activist and founder of the Future Forum, a local think tank. \u201cThis is Hun Sen\u2019s Westerdam problem, because even if he was doing the right thing, purely as a humanitarian, he will be seen as the puppet of China instead.\u201d \n On Monday, Mr Hun Sen announced yet another publicity stunt: He wants to invite the passengers of the Westerdam to a party. \n Masks won\u2019t be welcome.

A new interim report by the Chinese authorities also shows that the total number of registered disease cases has now increased to more than 2.700. The previous number was still around 2.000 diseases.\nThe Chinese authorities are trying to stop the spread of the virus by means of drastic travel restrictions. In addition to the millions of metropolises of Wuhan, from where the disease wave originated, the entire central Chinese province of Hubei is now under quarantine, affecting around 56 million people. As a further measure, major events were cancelled and fever controls introduced.\nIn order to limit contact between people, China extended the holiday to Chinese New Year's Eve by three more days until Sunday. In Beijing, universities, schools and kindergartens remain closed for the time being beyond the end of the New Year's holidays. The two largest amusement parks in Hong Kong, Disneyland and Ocean Park, closed their gates. On Sunday, the trade in wild animals was also banned throughout the People's Republic. The Beijing authorities sent text messages to mobile phone users in the Chinese capital urging them not to shake hands to welcome them.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nYou can't do that with Sic.\nI'm sorry. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nThe head of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, wants to discuss measures to combat the virus at the beginning of the week during a visit to China. \"I'm on my way to Beijing,\" he wrote on Twitter in the short-distance service. In the Chinese capital he wanted to meet with government representatives and health experts.\nIn North America, the authorities also confirmed further cases. According to the US health authority, there were five patients in Washington until Sunday afternoon (local time). On Sunday, two new cases were confirmed in California and one in Arizona. One of them had been confirmed by the Orange County Health Department in Los Angeles that the person had previously returned from a trip to Wuhan in China. Two other cases had already become known: a woman in the sixties in Chicago and a man in the thirties in Washington State on the West Coast in the north of the country.\nOn Saturday there was also a first \"provisionally confirmed\" case in Canada. In Toronto, a man came to the hospital who had also visited the Chinese region of Wuhan before. A formal confirmation by further testing in a laboratory in Winnipeg was still pending, the country's chief medical officer, Theresa Tam, explained on Sunday.\nIn addition to the US, several other countries reported individual cases of infection, including Australia, Japan and France. There was a suspicion in Austria and Berlin at the weekend. In both countries, however, there was later unveiling. The test results were negative, the Berlin Senate Board of Health reported on Sunday. A clinic in Vienna stated that the Chinese flight attendant had not been infected.\nThe government in Tokyo offers Japanese in Wuhan to fly them out of the deported city.

Ultimately, the symptoms resemble those of a Sars infection. No wonder, because the new virus docks at the same receptor. The test on the virus is usually based on the analysis of sputum (ejection) and lasts about two hours.\nThere is no special treatment for lung disease. Severely ill patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-lowering agents, the treatment of possible additional bacterial infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation.\nAccording to Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institut e of Tropical Medicine, vaccine candidates against Mers are currently being tested on humans. They are available, if successful results are expected, at the earliest in a few months. \"says Schmidt-Chanasit.\n-RESERVOIRE: The reservoirs of various corona viruses are located in the animal kingdom. At Mers are camels of origin, at Sars and the new agent the reservoirs are probably located at bats. On the human the Sars-organism probably jumped over from slime cats that are offered in Chinese markets. Also 2019-nCoV probably goes h from an animal market in China. It is currently not known what species the virus jumped from.\nFor protection against this virus as well as other viruses, experts recommend common hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance to the sick. The benefits of normal respiratory masks, as currently seen in China all over the streets, are estimated by Schmidt-Chanasit and threats as rather low.\n-PROGNOSEN: Some experts expect a long outbreak. \"We should consider this a marathon and not a sprint,\" said Chris Whitty, who advises the British government on health issues.\nThe impact of this outbreak is currently unclear because the situation is developing rapidly,\"a team of Anthony Fauci from the US National Health Institutes (NIH) wrote in the JAMA section. \"The virologist Drosten, on the other hand, can imagine that the epidemic ends as quickly as the Sars outbreak, which was quickly declared to have ended and 2004.\"I am inclined to think optimistically because this is a Sars-like disease. \"It is also true that there has so far been hardly any spread outside China.\"This is extremely encouraging.\"Sars continues to train, but only in the animal kingdom.

When I took off from Cairo on March 15 and was filling the health declaration form, several people asked me to 'not be honest' on it. I had a mild cough. I caught a cold on my vacation in Egypt. The health declaration form we had to submit at the Delhi airport asked three questions:\nAre you suffering from any of the following?\n- Fever (Yes / No)\n- Cough (Yes / No)\n- Respiratory problems (Yes / No)\nI ticked 'yes' next to 'cough' on both forms.\nFrom handing over my health declaration form at the screening desk at Terminal 3 of the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, to being taken to the isolation ward in Safdarjung Hospital as a 'coronavirus suspect', and finally being discharged... it was three days of going from shock, to denial, to despair, and acceptance. And once I accepted that I had to stay in the isolation ward come what may, it was a lot easier.\nI had a packet of Bhelpuri to look forward to. I had decided to open it on the last day of my stay at the isolation ward, but the call announcing my discharging came so suddenly that I couldn't react. It was pure happiness. I was going home.\nThere is not much to do in an isolation ward. But it got me back to writing about my day.\nThe following accounts are from my stay at the Safdarjung Hospital.\n***\nDAY 1: MARCH 16, 2020\nOur connecting flight from Bahrain landed in Delhi at 2.20 am. We proceeded to the thermal screening. As I handed my declaration forms, the person at the counter asked me if I had a fever, body ache, shortness of breath, any other respiratory problem, if I could hear any sound while breathing in. I answered in negative to all.\nThe person at the counter told me that I was 'Case A' since I was showing symptoms of Covid-19, and that I would have to be taken to an isolation ward. I was handed a hazmat suit. There was no mask in the kit so I continued with the one I was wearing. My passport was taken to Immigration and then I was escorted to a chamber at the airport where a doctor, in between bursts of coughing, informed me that I was going to be kept in an isolation ward at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, and that an ambulance would soon take me there.\nIt was 4 am by the time the ambulance arrived. As I walked out to the ambulance, three people from a news channel made a video, surreptitiously, of the process. When I accosted the reporter and asked her how she could breach my privacy, she spat back, \"Who are you to tell me what I should delete?\" I had to ask the security to intervene.\nI got into the ambulance and was driven to Safdarjung Hospital around 4.30 am. I was shown an isolation ward and told that a doctor would soon arrive to guide on the next steps.\nI came into the room and saw dirt on the floor and pigeon feathers lying around. There were cobwebs and a spider too. I waited on the sofa for an hour before walking out and asking for a cleaning of the ward. I asked for a bottle of water and soap, and was given a bottle of Kinley and a bar of Nirma soap.\nMy ward was then cleaned and sanitised. I asked for the doctor and was told that he was attending to a patient on another floor and would see me as soon as he was done there. It was 6 am.\nI also asked if I would be given a hospital gown. The ward boy asked me to change into my own clothes. I asked for a blanket or bedsheet; something to cover myself with because it's chilly. I was told they don't have anything. After 10/15 minutes of discussion, the hospital handed me a disposable bedsheet.\nAt 6.30 am, a doctor came visiting. He asked me for symptoms and I repeated what I'd told at the airport: a cough. He seemed a little surprised that I was brought to an isolation ward because of just a cough, but apparently the guidelines are strict. He asked me for travel history to any of the Covid-19 affected countries on the government list. I said no. Then he said that my samples would be taken for testing. The results will arrive in 2 or 3 days, and till then, I would have to stay in this isolation ward.\nI got a call two hours ago, checking if my samples had been taken for a test. It is 9 am, and my samples still have not been taken for a test. My passport is with the hospital. If people are not declaring symptoms, they have a damn good reason to not do so.\n***\nDAY 2: MARCH 17, 2020\nWhen you are thrown in a situation like this, your body recoils before reacting. Mine did too. But in India, if you have grown up with a messed up h\nealthcare system, you know when to be grateful.\nAt this isolation ward of Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital, I have got an ocean of gratefulness for these healthcare warriors. I saw about five people yesterday. Only their eyes from behind their special glasses. They are all dressed in hazmat suits so it is difficult to tell who's who. But I recognise their voices and the eyes. It's all in the eyes.\nMy samples were taken yesterday for the test. They have to find out if the virus is in my system. I can go home if the test says negative. It will probably be another 15 days in this room if the test says otherwise.\nThe world is at war. All of us who thought the third world war will be fought with nuclear weapons, starting somewhere off the South China Sea, were wrong about it. Yes, this war did start in China, but mainland Wuhan. The virus got out of China and took over the world. The world is now fighting its third great war, and at its forefront are these warriors, dressed in their hazmat suits, leaving no stone unturned in nursing people back to health.\nAt the airport when I got into that suit, I knew it wasn't going to be easy. If you've been healthy all of the 30 years of your existence and have avoided doctors unless for a ligament tear or an eye injury, you are wary of hospitals. In my mind, I am healthy. The doctor at the airport also told me that even if I am carrying the virus, and that's a big if, I was going to make a full recovery. The virus won't affect me. But I would need to be isolated till they are sure. It is a delicate time. We as a people cannot go wrong anymore.\nI have been seeing story after tragic story from Italy, where the death toll has been piling up like rubble after an earthquake; in France, where it's 15 days of a nationwide lockdown now; to South Korea, where the number of recoveries are now trumping the number of deaths. This is a pandemic. And we are bang in the heart of it.\nIn India, we are just about a week away from where Italy is now.\nYouth has that strange vanity about itself. When you're healthy, you think it's just a cough. You don't want to keep yourself away from people because we want company. Social distancing seems too harsh a concept for our social-media revolutionaries, where every fleeting moment is Instagrammed and every stray thought tweeted. Our immunity is strong, we think. Maybe. None of us wants to plague ourselves with ideas like social responsibility. They are all ideas after all, right?\nI stay alone, I told the airport officials at the health desk. So anyway I've been following social distancing. My office has asked us to work from home and not get out at all. It is not enough, the person at the desk said, You will need to go through the isolation ward.\nAs I look at these men and women tending to people in the rooms in this isolation ward, I feel happy that I chose to declare that cough on my health form. If there is even one per cent chance of limiting this contagion, I will do my bit.\nBeing isolated is not easy. I mean I live alone, so isolation is not a stange concept that way. But I can't get out of this room. I haven't seen a face but from within a hazmat suit for more than a day now. It can play with your head.\nBut in this room on the seventh floor of the isolation ward, at least there's a large window to throw that bitter gourd out of.\n***\nIt's a bright sunny morning. Outside the glass window on this floor, a family of pigeons go about their business, flapping their wings, cooing and flying around. No one has asked them to follow the protocols of social distancing. There is nothing called isolation in their world. There is no concern of Covid-19 either.\nLooking at these birds, the Wright Brothers drew up the sketch of the first aircraft. It was these birds that made Icarus take off with his pair of wings.\nSince that first flight, humankind has always looked up at the sky. All of us who did not grow up with airplanes, remember the thrill of that first flight. Once you've seen that slice of sky through your window, you want to return to the clouds. Could we ever anticipate that flying would mean putting all of the world at risk? This little microorganism has made us all take a long hard look at what we really need to live. With our wings clipped, our hubris tamed, we now go back to looking at the birds and waiting for that next flight.\nI have spent two days in this room. I'm at an isolation ward at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi my smartphone completes that sentence o\nn its own now. When I speak the sentence out, the words taste metallic from being spoken over and over again.\nThe breakfast arrived an hour later. Two slices of bread, mixed fruit jam, an orange, a glass of milk and tea. A person came in to clean and sanitise the room. Another person changed the bedsheets. Someone else came in to take my vitals. Yet another person asked me if I had drinking water.\nI am overwhelmed. I am not used to so much care, so many people constantly checking up on me. It feels strange. Almost unreal. I have lived 13 years of my life away from home, away from a family. The only family I know in this city is my immediate colleagues. Seeing a group of complete strangers going out of their way to do so much is simply not sinking in. I don't know how much gratefulness is enough. I don't know how to thank these women and men who are risking so much, so much every single day.\nA doctor came in and we realised our names were the same, but for one letter. We shared a laugh. Yesterday, a nurse said she had orders to shoot me on sight, before taking out her heat gun. A senior doctor told me yesterday, This is the best we can do under these circumstances. Till your results come in, think of this room as your hostel room. I had to tell him that I had lived in a hostel for three years, and this room was far better and cleaner than that. He laughed from behind that mask.\nMoments like these break the monotony of my day. Screens can only do as much. I have been reading every little shred of information on this new coronavirus. I am anxious. The results are yet to come in. The doctor told me today that a lot of new Covid-19 suspects have been brought in. The isolation ward is filling up.\nWhen I walked in into this wing of the hospital, all rooms were empty. Now, the sound of a cough from the adjacent room is a strange kind of reassurance. Last night, I heard two people from either side of my room talking to each other. One of them was flying in from Dubai, on India's list of Covid-19-affected places. The other person has been coughing incessantly. A woman from Argentina was very distraught when she was brought in yesterday. She told the staff here that she didn't understand English, before going on to ask for tea and coffee and cold water yes, in English.\nWe are all alone here. All isolated. But we're all together in that too. There are walls between the rooms but there are pigeons outside all our windows.\n***\nThree hours after I wrote my last entry, I got a call from the hospital. They said I could leave. My test results had arrived and I had tested negative for the novel coronavirus.\nAs I got ready to pull my bag out of the room, the ward boy opened the door. He had my plastic-wrapped lunch in his hand. I told him I was leaving. I couldn't see his face breaking into a smile, but the eyes announced he was happy. They had one less person to worry about.\n(The writer tweets as @ananya116)\n", "label": 0, "id": 1840}, {"content": "Covid-19! Labs came back on the child who was admitted to D. Stephania Hospital.

By Sakini Mohd Said dan Melati Mohd AriffKUALA LUMPUR (Bernama) -- The overwhelming demand for hand sanitisers in view of the new coronavirus outbreak has led to many pharmacies running out of stock.However, the question is, do people really need to use this cleansing agent to protect themselves against the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?Allaying public fears over the shortage of hand sanitisers in the market, Dr Rosnida Mohd Noh, an expert in internal medicine and infectious diseases, said there is nothing to panic about because washing one's hands properly with soap and water is still the most effective way to prevent infection.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There are two ways to cleanse one's hands to prevent infection by any virus, including the coronavirus. Washing your hands regularly with soap and water is one way, while the other way to keep your hands clean is by using a hand sanitiser containing at least 60 percent alcohol,\" said Dr Rosnida, who is attached to the Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Teknologi MARA.There is no reason to hit the panic button just because the stores are running out of sanitisers.\"All we have to do is to make sure we wash our hands regularly with soap and water, each time scrubbing our hands for at least 20 seconds to prevent any infection. This, in fact, is the most effective way to cleanse our hands. It is something that is easy and convenient to do on a daily basis,\" she told Bernama.\u00a0AT LEAST 60 PERCENT ALCOHOL CONTENT\u00a0Dr Rosnida also pointed out that in the case of hand sanitisers, it would be more effective to use one that contains at least 60 percent alcohol rather than those with lower or zero alcohol content.According to the website of the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hand sanitisers without 60 to 95 percent alcohol\u00a0\"may not work equally well for many types of germs; and\u00a0merely reduce the growth of germs rather than kill them outright\".It said although hand sanitisers containing more than 60 percent alcohol can inactivate many types of microbes very effectively when used correctly, \"people may not use a large enough volume of the sanitiser or may wipe it off before it has dried\".On the use of wet wipes to cleanse one's hands, Dr Rosnida said no authority, including the World Health Organisation (WHO), or health practitioner has recommended it as a means to prevent infections.After the 2019-nCoV was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019,\u00a09,356 cases of infection and 213 deaths were reported as of Jan 31, according to Chinese media reports.On Jan 31, the South China Morning Post reported that over the past 24 hours, more than 1,200 new cases were recorded in 17 cities in China.\u00a0PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY\u00a0Meanwhile, WHO has reported 98 coronavirus cases in 18 other countries, including eight human-to-human transmissions in four countries, namely Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the United States.\u00a0In Malaysia, eight positive 2019-nCoV cases were reported as of Jan 31, with all the patients involved being Chinese citizens.Amid the rising spread of the 2019-nCoV, WHO declared the virus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on Jan 30.The outbreak has increased public awareness on the importance of practising a high standard of personal hygiene.

We are not changing our standards for issuing Emergency Use Authorisations.\n\"This action today reflects our commitment to addressing critical public health needs and rapidly responding and adapting to this dynamic and evolving situation,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen M Hahn said.\nThe FDA guidance provides recommendations for test developers, including information regarding test validation, FDA notifications and interim confirmatory clinical testing.\nResponding to a question, Trump said he was considering closing the southern border to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\"We are looking also at (the) southern border. We have received a lot of power on the southern border over the last couple years from the courts, but we are looking at that very strongly,\" he said.\nIn a letter on Friday, several senators, including Ted Cruz, Martha McSally and John Cornyn, called for closing the coronavirus.\n\"As southern border Senators, we are concerned about the possible spread of the coronavirus across our borders,\" they said in the letter\nto US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan.\n\"We are similarly concerned about recent reports that the virus is spreading in Europe.

As global makers of household cleaners race to pitch their products as coronavirus killers, one major company, Reckitt Benckiser, may have a leg up on the competition.  \n The maker of Lysol and Dettol disinfectants said it has already obtained a strain of the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, from an independent lab and plans to use the strain to test whether its products kill the virus.  \n Watchdogs in the United States and Europe stipulate that a product must be tested in a regulator-approved lab to prove it can be effective against 99.9% of a virus before it can make a virus-killing claim on its label or in ads. In 2012, for instance, when MERS-coronavirus was a major public health concern, cleaning products had to prove they could kill 9,999 out of 10,000 MERS-Coronavirus cells, according to the agencies\u2019 requirement.  \n COVID-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus, originated in Wuhan, China, and has spread to more than 100 countries across the world.  \n The pandemic presents both a challenge and an opportunity for marketers of household brands to show how their products can help consumers deal with a frightening and fast-developing public health crisis. Doing it right could mean added market share; doing it badly will likely have other consequences.  \n \"This coronavirus is the new hype,\" said Michael Reynen, the former research head of Procter & Gamble's surface care business in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  \n British consumer goods maker Reckitt told Reuters it procured a sample of the novel coronavirus strain a few days ago and will soon be testing its existing disinfectants for commercial use at a virology lab.  \n The lab, which Reckitt declined to name, is in the process of duplicating the virus samples to enable sufficient quantities for testing, it said. The lab can test six Reckitt Benckiser products per week, with results of the first batch expected by the end of April, the company said.  \n Before Reckitt can re-label and stock shelves with its Dettol disinfecting sprays and Lysol toilet cleaners, it must complete a battery of regulator-mandated tests that typically take at least six months. It could take over a year if they need to create entirely new coronavirus-killing products.  \n Reckitt\u2019s move, which Reuters could not independently verify, could put some of its rivals on the back foot.  \n At stake are potentially billions of dollars in sales. Consumers spent nearly $22 billion on surface cleaners globally and another $1.43 billion on cleaning wipes in 2019. Clorox has about 4% percent and 37% percent of the surface cleaner and disinfecting wipes categories, respectively, followed by Reckitt, with share of 7.3% and 17.2%.  \n During public health emergencies, such as 'Bird flu,' the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and the 2013 MERS crisis, demand for surface cleaners and disinfecting wipes typically spikes, a Reuters analysis of Euromonitor data shows.  \n  \n 'RUSHING AROUND'  \n Reynen, who held several top research roles in his 24 years at P&G, said companies can spend a few thousand dollars to buy aggressive virus strains like the novel coronavirus from regulator-approved microbiology laboratories, which mail the samples with a glycerin solution in small, deep-frozen vessels.  \n \u201cProcter and Clorox will be rushing around to get a strain,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don't have it in their labs by now, I'd expect they will in the next week or two.\u201d  \n P&G, Clorox and Unilever declined to comment on whether they\u2019re pursuing or have managed to get samples of the novel coronavirus.  \n The companies likely do not have labs sophisticated enough to complete the rigorous six-month testing for a virus as nasty as this, so they outsource most of the work to external labs approved by regulators, a process that could cost about $100,000-$200,000, Reynen said. The contracted labs typically work with top biomedical research organizations such as the private non-profit Institut Pasteur in Paris and the German government agency Robert Koch-Institut in Berlin.  \n As deaths and illnesses from the novel coronavirus mount, companies are resorting to the most powerful claims they can make. The U.S. EPA and European Chemicals Agency do allow for certain carefully-worded statements even in the absence of testing against a strain of the novel coronavirus.  \n For example, Lysol, P&G and Clorox recently created websites promoting awareness, claiming\nsome of their disinfectant products \"demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to 2019 Novel Coronavirus\" and \"can be used\" against coronavirus on certain surfaces. P&G also put out a new line of sanitizing products called Microban 24 in late February with TV ads touting they were better than rival Lysol, but the company said the launch was not connected to the coronavirus outbreak.  \n Retail sales for Lysol wipes and rival Clorox wipes rose 184% in the week ended Feb. 29 versus last year, according to data firm Bloomreach. At the same time, shares of Reckitt, P&G and Clorox have outperformed the broader market, which has plunged since the first case of Coronavirus was detected in China on Dec. 31.

WUHAN (CAIXIN GLOBAL) - At least 19 people, mostly seniors, died in a social welfare facility in Wuhan located just one block away from the seafood market where the deadly Covid-19 outbreak is suspected to have originated, even though the local government acknowledged only one death from the virus. \n As of last Thursday (Feb 20), 11 seniors died from respiratory failure after recurrent fevers, a nurse at Wuhan Social Welfare Institute told Caixin. She said the facility's infirmary didn't have Covid-19 testing capability and many medical workers have had fever symptoms. \n The facility recently arranged chest CT scans at a nearby hospital for residents and staff. A scan report the nurse showed a Caixin reporter states that the patient has multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs, similar to many confirmed Covid-19 cases. \n Unexplained deaths from lung ailments among the elderly at the Wuhan Social Welfare Institute and similar facilities suggest that nursing homes may be another blind spot as the government's epidemic-fighting efforts have focused on hospitals and other communities. \n Last week it came to light that Chinese prisons reported more than 500 previously uncounted Covid-19 cases among guards and inmates. \n At least two other nursing homes in Wuhan also recorded deaths either possibly from the virus or confirmed cases. A family member of an 85-year-old resident at Gu Tian Rong Ji Nursing Centre told Caixin that his mother died at the nursing home and the family suspected she was infected by a care worker. The head of the nursing home acknowledged that one of the caregivers was confirmed with the coronavirus but denied that the deceased resident was infected by the worker. \n Another community senior care centre with about 40 residents also found eight tested positive for the virus. The rest of the residents and staff are quarantined at the centre and no visitors are allowed, a community worker said. \n The Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau disputed the report about the Wuhan Social Welfare Institute Friday night through the government's official WeChat account, saying the facility checked its residents and staff and found that 11 seniors tested positive for the virus and one of them died while being transferred to a hospital. \n According to the government response, the welfare facility started testing residents and staff on Feb 11, although Caixin learnt from sources that multiple seniors died between late December and Feb 19 after showing virus symptoms such as fever, breathing difficulty and loss of appetite. \n After Wuhan tightened quarantine measures to restrict people from leaving their homes and to send the sick into makeshift quarantine quarters, many people lost contact with elderly family members in nursing homes. Family members of people in nursing homes say they have been trying to find out how many residents may be infected, where the elderly are quarantined, whether there are caregivers, what test results show and whether the government can send more medical and care staff to institutions. \n A list of the dead at the social welfare facility obtained by Caixin showed 15 fatalities between Dec 23 and Feb 11 and four more on Feb 18. Of the total of 19 fatalities, only the death of an 83-year-old male on Feb 15 was clearly linked to Covid-19. Eight others were attributed to infections, including six to lung infections and two deaths from shock caused by infection. The remaining 10 fatalities were reportedly from other causes, and five of them took place before Feb 11 when the nursing home started testing for Covid-19. \n The nursing home has never before had so many deaths in such a short time, according to a staff member who has worked there many years. Except for one 27-year-old female with cholecystitis, all of the 18 others on the fatalities list were in their 80s and 90s and most had diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke or disabilities, according to the list. \n The facility, just a few hundred yards from the seafood market that may have been the starting point of the outbreak, is a combination senior hospital and nursing home. It is home to 458 senior residents with 190 staff, 21 property management personnel and eight care workers. The facility has been sealed off since Jan 21 as local authorities stepped up efforts to contain the outbreak. All staff have been asked to stay in the facility. \n A doctor in the welfare facility's i\nnfirmary said he participated in the treatment of a patient in late December who had a fever as high as 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit (42 deg C). The patient died from septic shock possibly caused by infection, but the cause of infection was unknown because no virus check was done, according to the doctor, who was later confirmed infected with Covid-19 himself. \n The doctor said he treated three seniors who died since late December. Several doctors, nurses and attendants have also shown symptoms of lung infection, the doctor said. \n A care worker said more than 10 seniors died during the Chinese New Year holiday. At first, they had fever and lost appetite. Those with recurrent fevers were transferred to quarantine rooms but died after a couple of days, the worker said. \n \"Since they were never confirmed with tests, we don't know whether they died from the virus,\" the worker said. \"But before the outbreak, even though many of the seniors at the nursing home have chronic diseases, we have never seen so many deaths in such a short time.\" \n A family member with the last name Zhu said he was told his 92-year-old father died from a heart attack on Feb 11 in the infirmary. The nursing home called the son on Feb 9, telling him to take his father to a hospital because he had a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (40 deg C). As the son had a fever himself and his community was locked down, he couldn't come to the nursing home. \n Some family members of deceased seniors told Caixin that the nursing home didn't take sufficient protective measures and residents were not even asked to wear masks. \n The doctor at the infirmary said the nursing home wasn't sealed off until Jan 21, when the outbreak was already spreading quickly in the city. Because it was close to the Chinese New Year, there were many visitors at the nursing home every day. It hasn't been ruled out that visiting family members might have brought the virus into the nursing home, the doctor said. \n A medical worker at the nursing home said it's also difficult to implement quarantine measures because of staff shortages and residents with dementia. \n Hubei Vice-Governor Wan Yong emphasised on Saturday in a video conference that nursing homes face severe situations as the elderly are at high risk of infection.

NEW YORK \u2014 A delicate but highly contagious virus, around 900 times smaller than the width of a human hair, is spreading from person to person around the world. The coronavirus, as it\u2019s known, has already infected people in at least 60 countries. \n Because this virus is so new, experts\u2019 understanding of how it spreads is limited. They can, however, offer some guidance about how it does \u2014 and does not \u2014 seem to be transmitted. \n If I cross paths with a sick person, will I get sick, too? \n You walk into a crowded grocery store. A shopper has coronavirus. What puts you most at risk of getting infected by that person? \n Experts agree they have a great deal to learn, but four factors likely play some role: How close you get; how long you are near the person; whether that person projects viral droplets on you; and how much you touch your face. (Of course, your age and health are also major factors.) \n What\u2019s a viral droplet? \n It is a droplet containing viral particles. A virus is a tiny codependent microbe that attaches to a cell, takes over, makes more of itself and moves on to its next host. This is its \u201clifestyle,\u201d said Dr Gary Whittaker, a professor of virology at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. \n A \u201cnaked\u201d virus can\u2019t go anywhere unless it\u2019s hitching a ride with a droplet of mucus or saliva, said Dr Kin-on Kwok, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2019s Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care. \n These mucus and saliva droplets are ejected from the mouth or nose as we cough, sneeze, laugh, sing, breathe and talk. If they don\u2019t hit something along the way, they typically land on the floor or ground. \n To get access to your cells, the viral droplets must enter through the eyes, nose or mouth. Some experts believe that sneezing and coughing are likely the primary forms of transmission. Dr Kwok said talking face to face or sharing a meal with someone could pose a risk. \n Dr Julian Tang, a virologist and professor at the University of Leicester in England who is researching coronavirus with Dr Kwok, agreed. \n \u201cIf you can smell what someone had for lunch \u2014 garlic, curry, etc. \u2014 you are inhaling what they are breathing out, including any virus in their breath,\u201d he said. \n How close is too close? \n Mr Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO), said it\u2019s best to stay 3 feet from a sick person. \n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that standing within 6 feet (about one metre) could carry risk. \n How long is too long to be near an infected person? \n It\u2019s not yet clear, but most experts agree that more time equals more risk. \n Will you know a person is sick? \n Not necessarily. \n Keep in mind that if you do get sick, most symptoms are as mild as a cold or the flu. Still, others who are infected with coronavirus never fall ill at all. (Technically, Covid-19 is the name for the sickness caused by the respiratory virus.) \n But the flip side of this is that it can be hard to tell who is capable of spreading coronavirus. \n In a growing number of cases, people without symptoms have infected others. The WHO still believes that most of those who have spread coronavirus were clearly ill at the time of transmission, Mr Lindmeier said. \n Can the virus last on a bus pole, touch screen or other surface? \n Yes. After numerous people who attended a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong fell ill, the city\u2019s Centre for Health Protection collected samples from the site. Restroom faucets and the cloth covers over Buddhist texts tested positive for coronavirus, the agency said. \n Technically, the virus widely known as the coronavirus is just the latest of many similarly shaped viruses. (Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, which resemble a crown or the sun\u2019s corona.) A study of other coronaviruses found they remained on metal, glass and plastic for two hours to nine days. \n Whether a surface looks dirty or clean is irrelevant. If an infected person sneezed and a droplet landed on a surface, a person who then touches that surface could pick it up. How much is required to infect a person is unclear. \n Coronaviruses are relatively easy to destroy, Dr Whittaker said. Using a simple disinfectant on a surface is nearly guaranteed to break the delicate envelope that surrounds the tiny microbe, rendering it harmless. \n As long as you wash your hands before touching your face, you\nshould be OK, because viral droplets don\u2019t pass through skin. \n If you are concerned about getting sick from someone who might have sneezed onto a product you\u2019ve ordered that\u2019s made in China, don\u2019t worry. In the time it takes to get to the United States, you should be safe, and if you are really concerned, you can clean the surface with a disinfectant or wash your hands after touching it. \n Does the brand or type of soap you use matter? \n No, several experts said. \n My neighbour is coughing. Should I be worried? \n There is no evidence that viral particles can go through walls or glass, said Dr Ashish K. Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. \n He said he was more concerned about common spaces than dangers posed by vents, provided there is good air circulation in a room. \n An infected neighbour might sneeze on a railing and if you touched it, \u201cthat would be a more natural way to get it from your neighbour,\u201d he said. \n Can I get it from making out with someone? \n Kissing would definitely spread it, several experts said. \n Though coronaviruses are not typically sexually transmitted, it\u2019s too soon to know, the WHO said. \n Is it safe to eat where people are sick with coronavirus? \n If a sick person handles the food or it\u2019s a high-traffic buffet, then risks cannot be ruled out \u2014 but heating or reheating food should kill the virus, Dr Whittaker said. \n Dr Jha concurred. \n \u201cAs a general rule, we haven\u2019t seen that food is a mechanism for spreading,\u201d he said. \n Can my dog or cat safely join me in quarantine? \n Thousands of people have already begun various types of quarantines. Some have been mandated by health officials, and others are voluntary and primarily involve staying home. \n Dr Whittaker, who has studied the spread of coronaviruses in animals and humans, said he\u2019s seen no evidence that a person could be a danger to their pet.

Researchers usually inject stem cell products into the lungs. \n Stem cells can improve the immune microenvironment in the lungs and reduce the risk of pulmonary failure caused by inflammation. \n Stem cells have the potential of self-renewal and differentiation, and can develop into corresponding functional cells and alveoli, and then repair the damaged tissue, Prof Zuo said. \n However, the wider use of stem cell technology to treat Covid-19 is still some time away. \n The safety and effectiveness of a new drug or therapy need to be verified with sufficient clinical trials, Prof Zuo stressed.\n", "label": 1, "id": 1863}, {"content": "First suspected case of coronavirus in Punjab, Haryana region.

SINGAPORE \u2014 For six months from March 2, companies in the manufacturing and services sectors will be able to hire work permit holders from China who are already in Singapore, without having to wait for them to exit the country first. \n Right now, the law allows companies in these two sectors to hire Chinese work permit holders only after they have left Singapore. This is because when work pass holders leave a company, their work permit must be cancelled and they must leave the country, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) stated on its website.\u00a0 \n MOM said in a statement on Tuesday (Feb 25) that it has partnered the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) to introduce this temporary measure to give companies in the two sectors more flexibility to manage their manpower needs amid the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak.\u00a0 \n \u201cCompanies facing a shortage of manpower can save on search and recruitment expenses.

Appearing before the cameras coughing and sweating profusely, the man leading Iran's response to the new coronavirus outbreak promised it was of no danger to his country.\n\"Quarantines belong to the Stone Age,\" Iraj Harirchi insisted.\nA day later, he himself would be in quarantine from the virus.\nHarirchi's story is a microcosm of what has happened in Iran amid the coronavirus pandemic. Roughly nine out of 10 cases in the Middle East come from the Islamic Republic, which has reported nearly 15,000 people infected and at least 853 deaths amid fears that cases may still be underreported. While most people who are infected recover, the virus spreads rapidly and can kill the elderly and those with breathing problems or other underlying illnesses.\nDays of denials gave the virus time to spread in Iran as the country marked the 41st anniversary of its 1979 Islamic Revolution with mass demonstrations and then held a parliamentary election in which authorities desperately sought to boost turnout.\nAlthough Iran has one of the Mideast's best medical services, its hospitals appear to be overwhelmed and authorities have asked for 172 million masks from abroad. It also has asked the International Monetary Fund for $5 billion, the first such loan for Iran since 1962.\nThe Islamic Republic has an opportunity to limit the virus as the Persian New Year, Nowruz, approaches. But authorities appear unable or unwilling to stop travel between major cities as local towns affected by the virus threaten to set up their own checkpoints to turn away or even attack outsiders. That's in sharp contrast to Iraq and Lebanon, Iranian allies that have restricted movement while facing a fraction of the reported infections.\nWhat happens next will not only affect Iran's civilian government and Shiite theocracy, whose officials already have fallen ill, but also the wider world.\n\"Judging by the fact that Iran has now asked for a $5 billion loan from the IMF, this speaks to how dire the situation is getting and them realizing that it's spun out of control,\" said Dr. Amir A. Afkhami, an associate professor at George Washington University who studies Iran.\n'PATIENT ZERO' AND AN ELECTION\nIn a country like Iran, where the state controls all broadcasters and journalists face restrictions, many things about the outbreak remain unknown. Chief among them is who was \"patient zero\" - the person who was first infected with the coronavirus in the nation, and where.\nPublic comments point to the city of Qom, 125 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of Tehran, on the country's windswept central desert plateau. How the virus arrived there remains in question.\nAuthorities suggested that perhaps an Iranian businessman returned from China with the virus. Qom is home to major Shiite seminaries that draw Chinese students. It also is along a $2.7 billion high-speed train route that a Chinese company is building, a sign of China's outreach to Tehran amid crushing US sanctions. China is also constructing a solar power plant there.\nFrom late January, worries could be seen on the front page of the pro-reform newspaper Aftab-e Yazd.\n\"Mysterious virus at Iran's gates,\" its banner headline warned as China began a lockdown to control the outbreak.\nYet travel between China and Iran continued.\nThe first two coronavirus cases were reported Feb. 19, with the announcement that both died in Qom. Since it can take up to two weeks to show symptoms, they could have gotten it in early February.\nIranian authorities haven't offered any details. Iran analysts suggest it might be because the country marked the 41st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution during that period.\nIran also held parliamentary elections Feb. 21. The government desperately wanted a large turnout to boost its legitimacy after shooting down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people on board. Days earlier, a US drone strike in Baghdad killed top Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, further shaking its credibility.\nIranian authorities already had disqualified thousands of candidates from running, ultimately tilting the election to conservatives. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei even later accused foreign enemies of trying to influence turnout with the outbreak.\n\"The pretext of an illness and virus was used, and their media did not miss the slightest opportunity to discourage people from voting,\" he said.\nThe election saw Iran's lowest turnout since the revolutio\nn, with some voters wearing the masks that everyone soon would want. But people already were dying and fear was spreading.\nSHRINES AND HAZMAT SUITS\nQom long has been the stronghold of Iran's Shiite clergy. A focal point of devotion is the golden-domed shrine of Fatima Masumeh, a Shiite saint. Crowds pray there 24 hours a day, seven days a week, touching and kissing the shrine.\nThat raises the risks for visitors. In Saudi Arabia, authorities have closed off access to the holiest sites in Islam over concerns about the virus. Churches, mosques, temples and shrines around the world have been closed or subject to stringent disinfecting campaigns.\nBut in Qom and elsewhere in Iran, the shrines stayed open despite civilian health authorities demanding they close. Mohammad Saidi, who oversees the Fatima Masumeh shrine, insinuated that closing shrines was part of a plot against Shiites by President Donald Trump.\n\"Defeating Qom is the dream of treacherous Trump and his domestic mercenaries, but this dream will not be realized even in their grave,\" Saidi said on Feb. 22.\nThat decision likely gave the virus time to spread. Police later arrested those who posted online video of themselves licking and kissing shrines.\n\"The city's religious epithet - 'the nest of the Prophet and his family' - was intended to reassure believers worldwide that it was insulated against epidemics and other disasters,\" wrote Mehdi Khalaji, a Qom-trained Shiite theologian who is an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy. \"If early reports about the spread of the coronavirus prove correct, Qom's status as the ideological capital of the Islamic Revolution helped make it the pathogen's transmitting center to the rest of Iran and at least seven other countries.\"\nSince then, hazmat-suited workers have fogged disinfectant and cleaned the shrines. Some mosques even hand out alcohol as a disinfectant to the poor despite Islam forbidding its consumption.\nBy Monday night, the Fatima Masumeh shrine and another one in Mashhad had closed, only to see online videos purport to show hard-line faithful storming the shrines' courtyard, demanding they open. But by that point, the virus had spread, reaching the highest levels of Iran's theocracy.\n'THE SITUATION IS TERRIBLE HERE AND I HOPE GOD HELPS US'\nLike blood from a beating heart, the infections in Qom coursed out across Iran in maps later shared by the Health Ministry. In Tehran, the virus began moving through the government and the Shiite theocracy.\nAmong those first infected was Harirchi, the deputy health minister who tested positive only a day after he downplayed the virus in a televised news conference.\nIt didn't stop there.\nThe virus killed Expediency Council member Mohammad Mirmohammadi, described as a close confidant of Khamenei. Hadi Khosroshahi, Iran's former ambassador to the Vatican, and Ahmad Tuyserkani, an adviser to Iran's judiciary chief, also died along with several lawmakers and a member of the country's Assembly of Experts.\nThe sick included Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar, better known as \"Sister Mary,\" the English-speaking spokeswoman for the students who seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 in the 444-day hostage crisis. The virus also infected senior Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri and two other Cabinet members, along with Revolutionary Guard members and doctors.\nSoon, even 80-year-old Khamenei was seen wearing disposable gloves at a tree-planting ceremony. President Hassan Rouhani, 71, was pictured at a teleconference with the nearest official a few meters (several feet) away.\nThe numbers soared. Iran's death rate from the virus now is higher than in other hard-hit nations.\nThat could be from the initial lack of testing kits and facilities. It also could be from what outside experts, Tehran lawmakers and other local leaders have alleged from the start: Iran was hiding the true number of infections and deaths.\nAuthorities initially denied that, especially after the BBC's Persian service said deaths far exceeded those reported at the beginning of the crisis. But that denial appeared to weaken over time.\n\"We found out a little late that the coronavirus had entered Iran because we mistook it for the flu,\" Reza Malekzadeh, a deputy health minister, later said.\nA man in Qom filmed rows of bodies in black bags and caskets awaiting burial for days in a trench lined with lime. He alleged all had tested positive for the coronavirus, although officials later said the bodies had been he\nld pending test results.\n\"The situation is terrible here and I hope God helps us,\" he said while walking through the mortuary.\nAuthorities later arrested him.\nPAST EXPERIENCES, NEW WORRIES\nDiseases have influenced Iranian history. Cholera outbreaks plagued its Qajar dynasty, long indebted to British and Russian powers. The chaos and debt set the stage for Iran's 1906 Constitutional Revolution and the creation of parliament.\nThat cholera outbreak saw Shiite religious leaders lash out at the West. Now, Iranian leaders, such as the head of its Revolutionary Guard and Khamenei himself, traffic in the baseless conspiracy theory that the coronavirus is a biological weapon created by the U.S., something echoed by Chinese officials as well.\n\"The psychology of the leadership in Iran has sort of an almost self-destructive need to double down on a lie just to sort of portray itself as competent,\" Afkhami said.\nThat's contrasted with the response to the El Tor strain of cholera that caused a pandemic through the 1960s. Iran produced millions of vaccine doses and inoculated its people, controlling its spread. It even gave broad-range antibiotics from the U.S. to pilgrims visiting Shiite shrines, Afkhami said.\n\"This rapid mobilization and this rapid response allowed the country to control the epidemic,\" he said.\nThat was under Iran's shah, toppled in the 1979 revolution. But even after, Iran fought off other outbreaks, and its hospitals, doctors and nurses are known as some of the best in the wider Middle East, with a network of clinics from villages to big cities.\nHowever, the system appears to be stretching at the seams, with online videos purporting to show field hospitals going up. Meanwhile, Iran's 80 million people, whose sense of high risk has been dulled by years of international isolation, crowd into grocery stores and butcher shops, suspicious of anything in the state media.\nNowruz, the Persian New Year, looms on Friday, a holiday when millions travel. The government repeatedly has stopped short of ordering any major travel restrictions. It hasn't explained why, but there could be worry about further angering its people or slowing down its anemic, sanctions-hurt economy.\nOnline videos show Iranians ignoring government demands to stay home and moving instead toward the coast of the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf. Residents of hard-hit Rasht, on Iran's coast, have threatened to attack out-of-towners.\n\"We expect that, God willing, we can contain the rising trend of the disease, not the disease itself, by March 26,\" said Harirchi, the health official who is recovering from COVID-19. \"But I say this very frankly: if the great people don't cooperate, the disease will continue to be there until late May or even in June, and turn into a huge crisis.\"\nAnd the man who once called quarantines a thing of the past added: \"I beg the people to minimize their trips and contacts, and isolate the infected people from others completely.\"\n", "label": 1, "id": 1881}, {"content": "U.S. could be next 'virus epicenter' as India locks down, global recession looms.

The first death outside China occurred at the weekend in the Philippines. It was a Chinese guy from Wuhan.\nIn the meantime, authorities expect the climax of the disease later than expected. \"We assume that the climax of the epidemic will be expected in ten days to two weeks,\" said the head of the national virus expert team, Zhong Nanshan. He thus corrected his prediction of a week ago when he predicted the climax for the end of this week. His mortality rate was 2,4 to 2,5 per cent.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so i\ncan change your heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nThe Coronavirus called 2019-nCoV first appeared on a market in Wuhan in December. Patients suffer from cough, fever, difficulty breathing, even pneumonia. The authorities are trying to contain the disease with drastic measures. For example, in the crisis region of Central China, 45 million people were killed in several cities. Overland connections with buses have been suspended, flights and trains have been reduced. The city of Wenzhou, more than 800-kilometre east of Wuhan, has imposed a curfew on the nine million inhabitants. Each family may select only one member who can go shopping every two days.\nThere are now also infections worldwide. So far, 180 cases have been confirmed in approximately two dozen countries. In Germany, the virus has been present at ten\nHuman evidence. Two of these patients belonged to more than a hundred people who had been picked up on Saturday on a special flight from Wuhan. According to the doctors, the two patients are doing well. \"They are currently being treated in isolation stationary and are medically well,\" said the Medical Director of the University Hospital Frankfurt, Jurgen Graf.\nThe head of the Frankfurt Health Office, Rene Gottschalk, warned against panic: \"I am much more afraid of the flu, from the point of view of the health authorities, than of this virus. For all we know, the course in Europe is very mild.\"\nAt the same time, rumours and misinformation about the infectious disease are growing, which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about. The outbreak of the pathogen 2019-nCoV was accompanied by a \"massive information epidemic\", a flood of information, the WHO reported. Some information is correct, but many are not. People could hardly distinguish between myths and facts.\nThe WHO therefore launched its own website and information campaign on Facebook, Twitter and other social media. It also addresses questions such as: Can eating garlic against the corona virus help? Answer: There is no proof of this. The smoking of fireworks, another wandering misinformation, does not help against the pathogen either. The acceptance of letters or parcels from China was safe. The virus does not survive long on such objects.\nOn its website, the health organization recommends, among other things, regular hand washing, even if the hands are \"not visible dirty\".\n", "label": 1, "id": 1883}, {"content": "Coronavirus: World prepares for coronavirus pandemic; global recession forecast.

SINGAPORE \u2014 From Wednesday (Jan 22), the Ministry of Health (MOH) will introduce more precautionary measures in order to reduce the risk of a new coronavirus being imported into Singapore, casting the net wider to isolate more people who may be exposed to the Wuhan virus.  \n In a statement on Tuesday, which came less than 24 hours after it announced that all travellers arriving at Changi Airport on flights from China will have to undergo temperature screening from Wednesday, MOH said that from Wednesday, too, people arriving in Singapore who have pneumonia and developed symptoms within 14 days after travelling to China will be isolated.  \n Those who have acute respiratory infection and developed symptoms within 14 days after being in any hospital in China will also be isolated.  \n These suspected cases will be isolated in hospital as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission. \n Previously, only those who have fever and pneumonia, and developed symptoms within 14 days after travelling to Wuhan in China would be isolated. \n Suspected cases meeting the widened definition will be referred to hospitals for further assessment. \n The authorities in China have confirmed on Monday that the virus can spread from human to human, and the number of pneumonia cases linked to the virus have risen both in China and in other Asian countries. \n The outbreak of the virus was first reported at Wuhan city in the Hubei province of China, and it is believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market there that also sells live animals. \n The virus, known as 2019-nCoV, is called a novel (new) coronavirus because it is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. It is in the same family as the ones that caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), as well as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak which killed almost 800 people worldwide from 2002 to 2003, including 33 in Singapore. \n Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Investigations found that the Sars virus was transmitted from civet cats to humans and the one causing Mers was from one-hump camels to humans, WHO said.  \n In rare instances, coronaviruses can evolve and then spread from human to human.  \n TAIWAN SEES FIRST INFECTION \n A panel from WHO will meet in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday to consider whether to declare an international public health emergency over the virus, the way it did with swine flu and Ebola. This could mean a call for a co-ordinated international response to the outbreak. \n Following exported cases in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, Taiwan reported its first confirmed case on Tuesday when a Taiwanese woman returned from Wuhan, had fever, and tested positive for 2019-nCoV. \n Close to 300 cases have now been reported across major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. \n  \n Symptoms of the pneumonia that is linked to the virus include a fever, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, among others. \n At Changi Airport, health advisory posters have been put up to advise all travellers on the precautionary measures to take when travelling to or arriving from Wuhan. \n MOH first started taking precautions since the start of the year, with temperature screening at Changi Airport for travellers arriving on flights from Wuhan, and suspected cases have been referred to hospitals for further assessment. \n SUSPECTED CASES IN SINGAPORE \n As of 3pm on Tuesday, MOH has not been notified of any new cases.  \n The seventh suspected case, a 44-year-old female Singapore resident with pneumonia who had travelled to Wuhan, tested negative for coronavirus, the ministry said. \n With medical practitioners being told to look out for pneumonia cases, MOH said that Singapore will likely see more patients who need to be tested because it \u201ccannot rule out the possibility of imported cases\u201d.  \n \u201cTo date, there have been no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus reported in Singapore. However, given the high volume of international travel to Singapore, we expect to see more suspected cases, and possibly imported cases,\u201d MOH said.  \n \u201cOnce a case is confirmed, contact tracing will be initiated, and we will implement strict isolation, quarantine, and infection control and prevention measures to prevent further transmission,\u201d it added.  \n MOH urges t\nhe public to remain vigilant and to adopt good personal hygiene practices.  \n \u201cAll travellers to China should monitor their health closely and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history,\u201d it said.  \n MOH also advised travellers and members of the public to adopt the following precautions at all times: \n Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats \n Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness \n Observe good personal hygiene \n Practise frequent hand-washing with soap, for example, before handling food or eating, after going to the toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing \n Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or runny nose \n Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately \n Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell. \n TOUR AGENCY TO MONITOR SITUATION \n Travel agency Dynasty Travel told TODAY that it does not offer tours to China until March 2020, which is when the peak travel period usually starts.  \n It does not offer tours to Wuhan and the closest tour to Wuhan is Changsha, which is four hours away by coach.  \n Ms Alicia Seah, director of communications at Dynasty Travel, said that Singaporeans tend to avoid the January to February period because the Chinese New Year holidays are quite packed with travellers. \n She added: \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation, and are hopeful that the authorities will handle the situation well.

India began on Wednesday a nationwide lockdown to contain spread of novel coronavirus infection in the country. The lockdown will be in place for three weeks, that is, till April 14. Incidentally, India\u2019s lockdown began on the day China opens lockdown in its worst-affected province Hubei except the epicentrethe city of Wuhan.\nThe two-month lockdown in China saw the country bring situation under control. China says almost all new cases of novel coronavirus in the country are of those coming from abroad. India hopes the three-week lockdown will cleanse the population of novel coronavirus.\nHowever, lockdown is not a guarantee that a person will not get the virus. You may tend to believe that social distancing is enough, but it is not.\nFomites can become the agent provocateur spreading Covid-19 during lockdown. Fomites -- epidemiologists use this term widely -- are objects that carry infection. Anything including clothes, utensils, newspapers, mobile phones, front-desk of a shop, packaged items, ATM machines and debit/credit cards, and even doorknobs, buttons in a lift, hand-rest of an escalator and furniture can be fomites.\nIn the previous coronavirus epidemic, SARS of 2002, fomites were a major contributor in Hong Kong, where the disease broke out. Since fomites are inanimate objects and cannot move on their own, humans have to come in their contact to get the virus.\nThe degree of risk posed by fomites depends on how long does novel coronavirus or any other pathogen survives on these objects.\nAs novel coronavirus, now officially named as SARS-CoV-2, is a new virus to humans, studies are still underway to know everything about it.\nWhat studies have found till date is that novel coronavirus has different life span on different objects. On plastic and steel, novel coronavirus has been found to stay virulent up to 72 hours or three days.\nHowever, their ability to infect decreases significantly as hours pass by. The problem is plastic and steel make up for far too many objects of everyday use. This means frequent cleaning of objects such as door knobs, elevator buttons, window pans, front-desks of shops etc is a must to fight Covid-19 effectively. Detergent or disinfectant is to be used for cleaning.\nOn a cardboard, novel coronavirus survives for up to 12 hours. This means if you order something, you should leave that package for 12 hours before opening the box. Or, sanitise it with an alcohol-based sanitiser.\nThis is exactly what you should be doing with your newspaper. The hawkers have more chances than others of catching the virus and passing the same on to newspaper surfaces, which are potential fomites when you touch early in the morning.\nGoing out is mostly restricted except for essential work and services in a lockdown. But if you have to go out, make sure you don\u2019t carry fomites to your workplace or bring fomites back home.\nRemember, you cannot also afford to become fomites yourself. For that, cover your head with disposable caps.\nTake a packet of milk as an example. You buy it from a milk parlour or a grocery store. Don\u2019t touch any surface there.

Two major global ratings agencies have downgraded India's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth rate for 2020 in two days. Both have attributed the cut in India's economic growth forecast to the spread of novel coronavirus. And, India is the only country likely to pay a heavy economic cost of novel coronavirus pandemic.\nMoody's on Tuesday marginally cut down India's GDP growth rate for 2020 from its February projection of 5.4 per cent to 5.3 per cent. Moody's had already slashed the growth forecast from 6.6 per cent to 5.4 in February.\nOn the other hand, S&P Global Ratings lowered India's growth forecast of India from 5.7 per cent to 5.2 per cent for 2020. The agency said not just India but the whole world could be in a deep recession under the impact of novel coronavirus pandemic.\nThe problem is bigger for India particularly as the novel coronavirus pandemic hit the world when it was already in a prolonged phase of economic slowdown. The country had just registered a seven-year low GDP growth rate of 4.7 per cent in September-December 2019 quarter when novel coronavirus hit world's economy beginning from the global manufacturing and supply hub of China.\nNovel coronavirus pandemic is already causing shutdowns in sector after sector. The travel and tourism industry is staring down the barrel with little light at the end. This has impacted the hotel industry badly. Even the medical sector, a provider of good amount of employment, has been badly hit in India.\nThough official records will take time to come out, industry estimates in India suggest that the aviation sector has seen up to 75 per cent drop in international bookings and 20 per cent in domestic bookings.\nLayoffs had already begun by February. Major travel agency Expedia laid off 3,000 employees globally to compensate the losses caused by novel coronavirus outbreak then.\nhttps://www.businesstoday.in/buzztop/buzztop-corporate/expedia-to-lay-off-3000-employees-as-coronavirus-hits-travel-industry/story/397040.html\nThe United States has seen sudden spike in layoffs across the country. Reports indicate the sharpest rise in unemployment in the US since the Great Recession of 1929-30. Some 45,000 workers have applied for unemployment benefits in Ohio in the US, more than 15,000 in New Jersey and another 8,000 in Connecticut. This is scary as they all suggest layoffs.\nSimilar reports have come from Spain, Norway, China, South Korea, Italy and a host of other countries. India too is having its share of layoffs. Sporadic reports of layoffs due to novel coronavirus outbreak have been pouring in but there is no consolidated official record of the same. Experts believe that hiring in services sector especially the IT field will be hit by up to 30 per cent due to novel coronavirus outbreak in India.\nIndia has shut down most of its shopping malls and cinema halls in big cities, advised people to stay home as much as possible. Major economic events such as the Indian Premier League have been deferred or curtailed. All these have employment consequences.\nAccording to a report the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) released in the first week of March, the unemployment rate in the shadow of novel coronavirus outbreak in India hit a four-month high of 7.78 per cent.\nGrowth projections for India have been declining in the past eight-nine months. Almost every revision of growth forecast by agencies has downgraded the GDP growth projection.\nAccording to the latest report of SBI Research released on Tuesday, the novel coronavirus-induced lockdowns could bring down India's GDP by almost 1 percentage point (0.9 per cent). This comes on account of a 5 per cent inoperability shock from travel, tourism and hotel industries. The SBI Research paper says the impact could be larger in 2020-21.\nThere is a rush world over to announce economy boosters. The US has announced multi-billion dollar impetus and rate cuts, many countries in Europe have announced tax cuts, the RBI in India did not alter the rates to maintain stability in the wake of novel coronavirus outbreak but it may announce a cut of up to 50 basis points in April to give a fillip to the market.\nStock markets the world over are crashing, wiping out crores of rupees. In India, the Sensex has lost around 10,000 points in less than a month.

Although human to human transmission is possible, it is unusual.\nThe mortality rate of avian influenza is very high, more than 50%, higher than 11% of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or new coronavirus (about 2% so far) that killed nearly 800 people worldwide in 2003.\n", "label": 1, "id": 1901}, {"content": "who declares covid-19 outbreak a pandemic. GENEVA \u2014 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on Wednesday (March 11), saying that cases outside China have increased\u00a013-fold and\u00a0the number of affected countries has tripled. \n WHO's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news conference\u00a0in Geneva, Switzerland:\u00a0\"Covid-19 can be characterised as a pandemic.\u00a0 \n \"We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a\u00a0coronavirus.\" \n The head of WHO said\u00a0that the organisation is\u00a0\"deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction\".\u00a0 \n \"We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear,\" Dr Tedros said. \"We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.\" \n He also said: \u201cThis is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector...\u00a0So every sector and every individual must be involved in the fights.\u201d \n The\u00a0deadly new\u00a0coronavirus has infected more than 120,000 people globally and killed more than 4,300 across more than 110 countries. \n An outbreak reportedly began in Wuhan, China's Hubei province in December last year at a seafood market that also sells live animals and it has since spread worldwide in a couple of months. \n An epidemic is explained as an outbreak of an illness that spreads unexpectedly\u00a0within a specific community. By contrast, WHO\u00a0defines a pandemic\u00a0as a worldwide\u00a0spread of a new disease. \n Before Covid-19, the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 was the last pandemic declared by WHO.\u00a0\u00a0 \n DEADLIER THAN SEASONAL FLU \n Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\u00a0told lawmakers that the pathogen is 10 times\u00a0deadlier\u00a0than the seasonal flu. \n Disease experts told AFP it is estimated that\u00a0each Covid-19 sufferer infects\u00a0two to\u00a0three\u00a0other people. That is a reproduction rate up to twice as high as seasonal flu, which typically infects 1.3 new people for each patient. \n Dr Robert Redfield, director of the US\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\u00a0told a congressional committee that the virus has spread to at least 38 states. \n \u201cRight now the epicentre \u2014\u00a0the new China \u2014\u00a0is Europe,\u201d he\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cAnd there are\u00a0many\u00a0people coming back and forth from Europe that are now starting to seed these communities,\u201d he said in a USA Today report. \n New York announced\u00a020 more cases. The state will ask businesses to consider staggering shifts and allowing employees to work from home, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. Washington recommended that all large gatherings be cancelled in the nation\u2019s capital. \n Britain announced a US$39 billion (S$54.3\u00a0billion) stimulus package, hours after the Bank of England cut interest rates, Bloomberg reported.\u00a0 \n German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to do \u201cwhatever is necessary\u201d. \n Italy vowed\u00a0to spend up to 25 billion euros (S$39\u00a0billion) to fight a\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0epidemic that has\u00a0killed 827 people and put the country's hospitals and economy under intense strain, AFP reported. \n On Wednesday, Singapore announced that eight of the newly confirmed\u00a0cases\u00a0are imported from overseas, the\u00a0largest number of such cases reported in a day by far. \n DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN EPIDEMIC AND A PANDEMIC \n Professor\u00a0Lawrence O Gostin, who specialises in\u00a0global health law at Georgetown University in the\u00a0US, told the New York Times\u00a0last month: \u201cTypically, an outbreak becomes an epidemic when it becomes quite widespread in a particular country, sometimes in a particular region, like (the mosquito-borne disease) Zika.\u00a0  \u201cWhereas a pandemic is thought to be a wide geographic spread of a disease on many parts of the world, many continents.\u201d \n DOES IT MATTER WHAT IT\u2019S CALLED? \n Dr Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told New York Times that the terms \"epidemic\" and \"pandemic\" imply different approaches to a health crisis. \n An epidemic suggests that the virus may be geographically limited\u00a0and that intervention by health agencies could help stop the spread. \n For a pandemic, where many places could be affected, there may be consequences for how many people or how much money or supplies are available, she said. \n When an outbreak covers the globe, international groups such as WHO and the United Nations have to divide their resources across greater territory than during a regional epidemic, she said. That would make a pandemic far more difficult to manag\ne. \n The approach to dealing with the pathogen could also be different, Dr Nuzzo said. \n If cases are everywhere, the authorities might stop trying to prevent it from entering a country and focus instead on trying to treat illness, slow the pathogen\u2019s spread and protect vulnerable people.

NEW YORK \u2014 The coronavirus that originated in China has spread fear and anxiety around the world. But while the novel virus has largely spared one vulnerable group \u2014 children \u2014 it appears to pose a particular threat to middle-aged and older adults, particularly men. \n This week, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published the largest analysis of coronavirus cases to date. Although men and women have been infected in roughly equal numbers, researchers found, the death rate among men was 2.8 per cent, compared with 1.7 per cent among women. \n Men also were disproportionately affected during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreaks, which were caused by coronaviruses. More women than men were infected by Sars in Hong Kong in 2003, but the death rate among men was 50 per cent higher, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. \n Some 32 per cent of men infected with Mers, compared with 25.8 per cent of women. Young adult men also died at higher rates than female peers during the influenza epidemic of 1918. \n A number of factors may be working against men in the current epidemic, scientists say, including some that are biological, and some that are rooted in lifestyle. \n When it comes to mounting an immune response against infections, men are the weaker sex. \n \u201cThis is a pattern we\u2019ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract \u2014 men can have worse outcomes,\u201d said Dr Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \n \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this with other viruses. Women fight them off better,\u201d she added. \n Women also produce stronger immune responses after vaccinations, and have enhanced memory immune responses, which protect adults from pathogens they were exposed to as children. \n \u201cThere\u2019s something about the immune system in females that is more exuberant,\u201d said Dr Janine Clayton, director of the Office of Research on Women\u2019s Health at the National Institutes of Health. \n But there\u2019s a high price, she added: Women are far more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, in which the immune system shifts into overdrive and attacks the body\u2019s own organs and tissues. \n Nearly 80 per cent of those with autoimmune diseases are women, Dr Clayton noted. \n The reasons women have stronger immune responses aren\u2019t entirely clear, and the research is still at an early stage, experts caution. \n One hypothesis is that women\u2019s stronger immune systems confer a survival advantage to their offspring, who imbibe antibodies from mothers\u2019 breast milk that help ward off disease while the infants\u2019 immune systems are still developing. \n A stew of biological factors may be responsible, including the female sex hormone estrogen, which appears to play a role in immunity, and the fact that women carry two X chromosomes, which contain immune-related genes. Men, of course, carry only one. \n Experiments in which mice were exposed to the Sars coronavirus found that the males were more susceptible to infection than the females, a disparity that increased with age. \n The male mice developed Sars at lower viral exposures, had a lower immune response and were slower to clear the virus from their bodies. They suffered more lung damage, and died at higher rates, said Dr Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology at the University of Iowa who was the senior author of the study. \n When researchers blocked estrogen in the infected females or removed their ovaries, they were more likely to die, but blocking testosterone in male mice made no difference, indicating that estrogen may play a protective role. \n \u201cIt\u2019s an exaggerated model of what happens in humans,\u201d Dr Perlman said. \u201cThe differences between men and women are subtle \u2014 in mice, it\u2019s not so subtle.\u201d \n Health behaviours that differ by sex in some societies may also play a role in disparate responses to infections. \n China has the largest population of smokers in the world \u2014 316 million people \u2014 accounting for nearly one-third of the world\u2019s smokers and 40 per cent of tobacco consumption worldwide. But just more than 2 per cent of Chinese women smoke, compared with more than half of all men. \n Chinese men also have higher rates of Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, both of which increase the risk of co\nmplications following infection with the coronavirus. Rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are almost twice as high among Chinese men as among women. \n In the United States, women are more proactive about seeking health care than men, and some small studies have found the generalisation applies to Chinese students at universities in the United States, as well. \n In unpublished studies, Chinese researchers have emphasised that patients whose diagnoses were delayed, or who had severe pneumonia when they were first diagnosed, were at greatest risk of dying. \n One study of 4,021 patients with the coronavirus emphasised the importance of early detection, particularly in older men. And men have been turning up in hospitals with more advanced disease. \n But in areas of China outside Hubei province, the epidemic\u2019s epicentre and where the majority of those affected are concentrated, the patterns are different: The illness appears to have dramatically lower mortality rates, and men are being infected at much higher rates than women, according to the Chinese CDC analysis. \n Men may have a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d when it comes to the coronavirus, said Dr Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunology at Yale University who studies why some viruses affect women more severely. \n Gathering and analysing data about the new virus by sex is important both for the scientists studying it and for the general public, experts said. \n Since the start of the outbreak, for example, public health officials have emphasised the importance of washing hands well and often, to prevent infection. But several studies have found that men \u2014 even health care workers \u2014 are less likely to wash their hands or to use soap than women, Dr Klein said. \n \u201cWe make these broad sweeping assumptions that men and women are the same behaviourally, in terms of comorbidities, biology and our immune system, and we just are not,\u201d Dr Klein said.

The Coronavirus has long since also reached the financial markets. Rarely did Wall Street begin a week with such great uncertainty. Are the coming days going to bring a relaxing course or is everything going to get worse? That's the big question. Last week was, in any case, the worst for the financial markets since the crisis 2008. The merchants'screens turned deep red, the color in which losses are displayed.\nThe S&P 500, the share index, which brings together the 500-largest and most important US companies, lost over four billion dollars in just seven trading days. For comparison: This corresponds to the gross domestic product of Germany. And not only did stocks collapse, raw materials such as copper, aluminum and zinc also broke in. The price of oil fell below fifty dollars, not even gold, otherwise considered a safe harbour, was spared. There was talk of a \"pandemic panic\". And more and more often by a second Lehman Brothers.\nHowever, there are differences with the panic that followed the collapse of the investment bank in September 2008. At the time, it was a misdevelopment in the financial sector that led to a crisis in the real economy. This time it is the other way round: the concern that the pandemic may result in a recession triggers the collapse of the courses. However, the sudden violent reaction on Wall Street is similar in both cases.\nTen days ago the S&P 500 had reached a new record high. The Coronavirus had already killed hundreds of people and infected tens of thousands. But the investors saw this as a major problem for China. Many even hoped that Corona would provide a new wave of cheap money through the central banks. That's what it looks like. People's Bank of China has already lowered interest rates and Fed Chief Jay Powell has also signalled that the US Federal Reserve is ready to prevent the worst.\nLast week, there was nothing left of this calm. Covid-19 had arrived in Italy, and the news certainly contributed to this. But the virus had already spread in South Korea before and also in Iran, which had hardly affected the markets. The mood went down almost overnight. This is a pattern that is repeated in the financial markets.\nLehman also had evidence of problems with the bank months before the collapse. But the end came surprisingly on that fateful Friday, when no trading partner wanted to advance more funds to the bank. This was also the case with the euro crisis. For years, investors lent money to the Greek Government by buying their bonds. They did so because they believed that the German Government and the rest of the EU would intervene if Greece could no longer pay. But when the Greek government dramatically increased its figures on sovereign debt in the autumn of 2009, investors were no longer so sure. Prompt, the risk premium on Greek government bonds skyrocketed: the euro crisis began.\nBut the speed at which the turn took place in the case of the Corona pandemic has rarely seen Wall Street. You have to go back to the 1929 to find a similar crash. This, and not the heavy losses per se, is the real danger. For a large part of the market participants have borrowed the money from which shares, bonds or derivatives are purchased. To satisfy their creditors, they must sell assets. This further increases sales volumes and further lowers prices, which in turn means that more market participants have to sell in order to meet their payment obligations. A vicious circle that quickly also encompasses areas of the capital market that are not directly threatened by the virus and its economic consequences.\nAnd there's another threat. While the banks were at the centre of the Lehman crisis, this time this should not be the case. Especially in the US, money houses are much better protected. But the credit risk threatens to spread in other ways.\nBecause of the low interest rates, so-called junk bonds, i.e. mill loans, have enjoyed enormous popularity among investors in recent years. These debt securities are issued by undertakings which have a higher risk of\n(ii) to comply with their payment obligations. In order to attract investors, they pay higher interest rates.\nLast week, the investors ran out of paper. In recent days, they have deducted almost seven billion dollars from junk bond funds. To clarify the significance: the inflows over the past year have been at 14-billion. The iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, the largest US junk bond fund, reportedly reported its largest influx of investor money in one day only last Tuesday with 1,6 billion dollars, according to financial news service Bloomberg. Since there are no buyers for the risky bonds, companies could not borrow fresh capital. All last week there was no new issue of junk bonds on the US market.\nIn fact, this is the time of year when companies are refinancing on the credit market. If it remains so, a credit crunch threatens, not unlike the time after Lehman. The irony is that the situation is also so dire because the central banks provided cheap money to the financial markets worldwide to deal with the consequences of the Lehman crisis.\nLarge investors, including insurance companies, pension funds, foundations, therefore took ever greater risks. There was hardly anything else left for them, as safer investments did not yield enough returns to meet their obligations to pensioners and others. So, ten years later, a credit crisis could trigger the next one. The panic over the Coronavirus in this sense would actually be Lehman 2.0.\n", "label": 1, "id": 1923}, {"content": "The good news and bad news of another day of fighting the coronavirus (and the situation of the Portuguese).

Health authorities are closely watching an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a new virus that originated in China. Governments are stepping up surveillance of airline passengers from central China and taking other steps to try to control the outbreak.\nHere\u2019s what you should know about the illness:\nWHAT IS THE NEW VIRUS?\nScientists have identified it as a new coronavirus. The name comes from the Latin word for crowns or halos, which coronaviruses resemble under a microscope. The coronavirus family has many types that affect people. Some cause the common cold while others originating in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses such as SARS severe acute respiratory syndrome or MERS Middle East respiratory syndrome.\nWHERE DID IT COME FROM?\nHOW WIDESPREAD IS IT?\nChina has identified 440 cases and nine deaths, most of the illnesses and all of the deaths in Hubei province. Cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, the US and Taiwan. The outbreak coincides with China\u2019s busiest travel season as people visit their families or go abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday. That travel rush is expected to spread the disease more widely.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In serious cases, the virus can cause pneumonia.\nHOW IS IT TREATED?\nThere is a test to identify the virus, but no vaccine to prevent an infection. Patients with the virus have been isolated in hospitals or homes to prevent spreading it. The symptoms are treated with pain and fever medication, and people are advised to drink plenty of liquids and rest while they recover.\nHOW IS IT SPREADING?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Scientists believe the new virus can spread from person to person in close contact through the respiratory tract.\nCOULD IT BE AS BAD AS SARS?\nSo far, the virus appears less dangerous and infectious than SARS, which also started in China in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people.

South Korea has banned travellers only from \u200bthe Chinese province of Hubei, where the global outbreak started. \n To Mr Moon\u2019s government, banning travelers would not have had a \u201cpractical benefit.\u201d To critics, not doing so may have helped the highly infectious pathogen spread, further undercutting the chances for the economic recovery the country craved.\u200b \n An editorial in the influential conservative daily Chosun Ilbo warned\u200b Wednesday \u200bthat fighting the outbreak without banning Chinese visitors was \u201clike trying to catch mosquitoes while keeping the windows open.\u201d \n Mr Moon\u2019s political enemies have long accused him of being pro-Chinese\u200b or afraid to challenge China\u2019s leader, Mr Xi Jinping. \u200bOn\u200b Feb 20, when he was on the phone with Mr Xi, Mr \u200bMoon said that \u201cChina\u2019s difficulties are our own difficulties,\u201d according to his office.\u200b \n A spokesman for Mr Moon, Mr Kang Min-Seok, noted that no visitor from mainland China had tested positive since South Korea tightened its screening of Chinese arrivals on Feb 4. He also cited the diminishing number of new Chinese cases outside Hubei. \n The opposition is also lashing out at some of the government\u2019s early decisions. \n As it was later discovered, members of the Shincheonji church in Daegu,\u200b in the southeast of South Korea, began developing symptoms around Feb 7-10, days before Mr Moon said the worst was over. The worshippers continued to attend Sunday services, expectorating and spreading the virus as \u200bhundreds of congregants loudly sang and prayed in the tightly seated church. \n At the time, the government repeatedly assured people that they did not need to cancel large gatherings.\u200b Mr Lee In-young, the majority whip in the National Assembly, urged people to \u201creturn fast to normal lives.\u201d \n Even when Mr Moon said that things had \u201cstabilised\u201d on Feb 13, Ms Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that it was \u201cstill too early to say that the outbreak had plateaued.\u201d \n \u201cWe will be able to say so much later, only when the number of patients in China \u200bdrops drastically and the danger of the virus entering our country from there \u200bhas decreased,\u201d Ms Jung told reporters\u200b that same day. \u201cWe have to remain vigilant.\u201d \n The government\u2019s optimism faded after \u200ba 61-year-old female church member tested positive on Feb 18, becoming South Korea\u2019s 31st patient. Since then, the cases have skyrocketed, sometimes\ndoubling or tripling in a single day. \n Once the new coronavirus took root, South Korean health officials aggressively \u200btracked down \u200band isolated patients\u200b, testing over 10,000 people a day. The recent spike in the number of confirmed cases is related in part to that aggressiveness. \n Officials also released data quickly. Smartphone applications provided\u200b people with real-time updates on places patients had visited and \u200bsent users notifications when they approached such locales. \n \u200bBut if the coronavirus appears less lethal than Mers, it has proved far more contagious. As it spread across the country, South Koreans began wondering whether they could trust Mr Moon\u2019s strategy, which relied essentially on the people\u2019s cooperation and awareness. \n While the government has aggressively warned people to take precautions by wearing masks and washing hands, it has tried to keep as much of the economy running as possible. \n There was also a political risk in pursuing drastic measures. When the government tried to ban weekend anti-government rallies over health concerns, the participants accused it of political suppression. \n As Mr Moon\u2019s Democratic Party announced a \u201cmaximum containment\u201d of Daegu and nearby towns this week, many conservative politicians took that as a decision by South Korea to cordon off its own towns while being spineless toward China. The political blowback was swift, forcing the government to deny any lockdown plan. Mr Hong Ihk-pyo, the party spokesman who announced the maximum containment, resigned. \n \u200bSouth Koreans\u2019 anger spiked this week when they learned that some Chinese cities had begun quarantining South Korean visitors\u200b upon landing at their airports, while South Korea had not imposed such restrictions on Chinese arrivals. \n An online petition to Moon\u2019s office demanding a ban on Chinese visitors had more than 760,000 supporters. \n Others in South Korea focused \u200btheir ire on the Shincheonji church,\u200b which has been branded as a cult by mainstream religions\u200b. The church\u2019s practices\u200b, like sitting tightly together and aggressively proselytising, have been cited as factors in the quick spread of the illness.\u200b A petition asking the government\u200b to forcibly disband the church had more than 920,000 signatories.\u200b\u200b \n \u201cShincheonji has no right to talk about freedom of religion,\u201d said Mr Rhyu Si-min, a former health minister whose YouTube commentaries are \u200binfluential among supporters \u200bof Mr Moon. \u201cThrough their acts, they have endangered the lives of many citizens.\u201d\u200b \n Mr Moon called for the country to join hands together, calling the coming days a \u201ccritical period\u201d in \u200bdetermining whether the virus will continue to spread through the country. \u200bThis week, his government said it would check all 210,000 Shincheonji members across the country \u200bfor the virus. \n Others accused the government of shifting the blame to the church, when its members were also victims of the virus. \n \u201cWhat we have seen so far is a total failure of our disease-prevention system\u200b,\u201d said Mr Choi Dae-zip, president of the Korean Medical Association, referring to\u200b his group\u2019s repeated call for an early ban on Chinese visitors.\u200b\u201cThe biggest reason for that failure is that the government ignored the very basic principle of disease control, which is blocking the source of infection.\u201d THE NEW YORK TIMES\n", "label": 0, "id": 1934}, {"content": "Covid-19: The bitter truth about using hydroxychloroquine as a preventive drug. Hydroxychloroquine is slightly more tolerable, but is equally dangerous in its side effects if taken without supervision, as is an entire class of anti-malarial drugs. It also bears similarities in its mode of action against malaria to the world\u2019s first anti-malarial drug--quinine. In Peru, the Inca civilisation used the bark of the Cinchona plant to treat shivering (which many say could have been caused by malaria or low-grade fever). In 1633, this herbal medicine was introduced in Europe to reduce fever, but the compound quinine was first extracted from the bark in 1820. In 1944, it was synthesised in a laboratory and began to be used to treat malaria. There has never been a synthesis that can compete with the extraction from the bark. But in 1934, chloroquine was synthesised as a quinine alternative and eventually began to be used more popularly for malaria treatment, especially in areas where quinine resistance might have developed. Hydroxychloroquine came along in the 1950s, and is said to be slightly less extreme in side effects than both its predecessors. It is on the World Health Organization\u2019s Model List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective drugs needed in a health system. Quinine itself is no longer on it.\nThere has been widespread uproar over the ICMR recommending the drug for protection against COVID-19. Doctors say the medical evidence is still too limited to be sure of hydroxychloroquine\u2019s antiviral properties. The antiviral effects of chloroquine were described in a research paper published in The Lancet in 2003. Chloroquine exerts direct antiviral effects, inhibiting pH-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses, including members of the flaviviruses, retroviruses and coronaviruses,\u2019 it noted. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in a lab setting, but a further study concluded that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine, with a more tolerable safety profile. It has been used to study several viral infections, including Ebola, influenza and dengue. But several studies noted that meaningful action requires a large dose of the drug inside the cells, and it can increase toxicity, which is a key concern when using both the drugs.\nThe idea to use hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 didn\u2019t originate from US president Donald Trump\u2019s tweet about the drug as a possible cure, but came from two small studies in China and France, and some anecdotes of successful treatments, including the case treated in Jaipur (where it was used in combination with Oseltamivir, Lopinavir 200 and Ritonavir). \"We have already isolated the strain of COVID-19 in India. Before a treatment is approved by the government, it needs much more testing. Right now, doctors are using drugs based on individual symptoms,\" says Dr K. Sujatha Rao, former Union health secretary. The Chinese study (which included 100 patients), in particular, garnered a lot of attention after it showed that hydroxychloroquine reduced the viral load. The symptoms of COVID-19 were not as severe and patients were cured faster. But health organisations, including WHO, have not approved the use of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment or prevention. While both might be game-changers for the ongoing pandemic, large-scale studies need to be done before they can be certified as safe. Let us not forget that when scientist Hans Andersag first synthesised chloroquine, it was not used for almost a decade as the initial evaluation considered it to be too toxic.\nIt is very important to note that ICMR has specified only two categories of high risk\u2019 people who should use hydroxychloroquine for prevention or prophylaxis--health workers and household contacts of positive cases. A national taskforce has been set up to ensure that the use is restricted and the drug is only sold on prescription. They have also specified in an online notice that this should not instil a false sense of security against COVID-19 and users should continue with hygiene and social distancing protocols. A person reporting symptoms to the drug needs to immediately seek out the medical practitioner who prescribed it.\nBut ICMR forgot that information spreads faster than caution today. The drugs have already sold out in many online pharmacies in the country. And reports of anti-malarial drugs being in demand are doing the rounds. This was\nto be expected--after Trump\u2019s endorsement, three people were hospitalised in Nigeria for chloroquine poisoning, and the UK had to ban the export and hoarding of the drug. In India, the drug is readily available and affordable. And while doctors have attested to the drug\u2019s potential against COVID-19, few are willing to take the entire leap of faith like ICMR. Most notably because of the potential consequences of people using the drug as self-medication. \"The adverse effects of this drug are life-threatening if taken without guidance. Right now, there is mass fear against COVID-19; people believe it will kill them. Suddenly, if you announce a drug for prevention, and it is available readily, people will think let me also try it,\" says Dr K.K. Aggarwal, cardiologist and head of the Confederation of Medical Associations of Asia and Oceania (CMAAO). Better communication should have been decided on to ensure everyone does not go out and buy it. This is certainly not a drug for home use. Yet, as social media buzzes with images of people stocking up on hydroxychloroquine and other antimalarial drugs, it seems many do believe it will protect them.\nThe quinoline family has a lot to offer modern medicine and humanity even today. But these are still to be entirely understood, and can do great damage if taken without knowledge of the side effects. In 1633, when quinine was brought to Europe to be used against fever, only a select few physicians reportedly had it because the toxicity was extremely high and they did not know how it would affect everyone. There was no Twitter, no e-medicine, and no TV--drugs could be given to a small, high risk, sample without everyone wanting to use it, which is perhaps what the ICMR was aiming for. But in 2020, publicly approving a drug needs to be thought through much more and precautions need to be in place before announcements. The repercussions of people using hydroxychloroquine at home are not worth the little bit of hope it has brought to our lives.\n", "label": 1, "id": 1935}, {"content": "covid-19: second known case of taxi driver infected with virus.

Japan on Friday reported a second confirmed case.\nThe confirmed cases in China for the first time crossed the 1,000 mark and rose sharply to 1,287 as of Friday with 237 people in critical condition battling for their lives in China, the National Health Commission said on Saturday.\nAlmost all provinces, including Beijing, are reporting steady rise in the number of cases mostly of people who travelled from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe pneumonia situation has claimed 41 lives, including 39 in central China's Hubei province and one in north-eastern province Heilongjiang, the health commission said on Saturday.\nAdditionally, a total of 1,965 suspected cases have also been reported, it said.\nChina's Communist Party has set up a leading group to manage the coronavirus epidemic, state media reported on Saturday.\nThe decision was made at a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee -- the party's top leadership tier -- chaired by President Xi.\nIn the meeting, Xi said that people from different ethnic groups and sectors should work together to support efforts to contain the spread of the deadly virus.\nThe country is facing a 'grave situation', he was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post.\n'As long as the nation has strong confidence and makes joint efforts with scientific and targeted measures, the battle of the prevention and control of the contagion will be won,' Xi said, chairing meeting on the day of the Spring Festival or Lunar New Year.\nXi called for all-out efforts to prevent and control the coronavirus-related pneumonia and extended his heartfelt gratitude to the medical staff on the frontline.\nHe also called for strengthening the protection of medical staff, ensuring the market supply of materials in need, intensifying disclosure of related information to guide the public opinion as well as the mobilisation of social forces to uphold the overall stability of society.\nThe\u00a0Communist Party of China meeting urged concrete efforts to ensure access to adequate supplies of materials to Wuhan.\nThe participants of the meeting also urged all-out efforts to treat infectious patients, and disclose disease-related information in an accurate, open and transparent manner to address concerns from both at home and abroad, it said.\nWhile underscoring the need to strengthen people's awareness in disease prevention and boost the confidence of the public, they also called for timely communication with the World Health Organisation (WHO), organisations of relevant countries and regions, as well as Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and Taiwan province, and stepping up cooperation to jointly uphold regional and global health security, the statement said.\nWuhan, the city of 11 million people, is where the virus is believed to have first emerged.\nThe victims' average age is 73, with 89 being the oldest and 48 youngest.\nAlso China's National Health Commission has dispatched 1,230 medical staff to Wuhan to combat the coronavirus outbreak in the region.\nLocal media earlier reported that 450 military medical personnel have also landed in the city to offer support.\nAlso, the local government in Wuhan on Saturday has banned all vehicles, including private vehicles in downtown Wuhan to curb virus, a report by the Daily said.\nThe city along with 12 cities in Hubei province have already banned all public transport to prevent the virus from spreading.\nThe virus epidemic has triggered a cause of concern for India too as many of the around 700 Indian students studying in universities of Wuhan and Hube\ni provinces are still stuck up there.\nThe Indian Embassy has established hotlines to keep close contact with them.\nAccording to sources in Beijing, India is understood to have requested China to permit over 250 Indian students stuck in Wuhan, the epicentre of the new SARS-like virus, to leave the city.\nAuthorities have prevented anyone from leaving Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the heart of the viral outbreak.\nWhile majority of the Indian students left for home on Chinese New Year holidays, over 250 to 300 students are said to be still in the city and its surrounding areas.\nBesides the students, the fast spreading virus has become a major worry for their parents back home.\n", "label": 1, "id": 1941}, {"content": "Coronavirus deaths in the U.S. Italy travel signs worsened.\nAfter the first death was announced by the new Coronavirus in the country, the US advised against travelling to the affected regions of Italy and South Korea.\nTravel signs have been tightened to the highest level four, as US Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday at the White House in Washington. In addition, new restrictions would be imposed on Iran. Foreigners who have been in Iran in the last 14-day period are no longer allowed to enter the United States. Pence, on behalf of President Donald Trump, heads the working group on the fight against the Coronavirus in the White House. Americans should exercise particular caution in Europe at the moment, Trump said shortly afterwards in a speech.\nShortly before, the first death victim in the United States had been reported by the new Coronavirus. The victim's exact identity was first confused: Trump said at a White House press conference that it was a woman in the late 1950s in Washington, United States. Shortly thereafter, Jeff Duchin, chief health officer of Seattle and King County, said at a telephone press conference of the U.S. Health Authority CDC that it was a man in his late 50s. CDC director Robert Redfield later tweeted that the CDC had previously mistakenly identified the victim as a woman in an information for Trump and Pence.\nHow the man was infected was still completely unclear, said Health Commissioner Duchin. \"At this point we do not see any connections.\" But he had health problems before.\nIn addition, the number of known cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the US has increased to 22, said Nancy Messonier, head of the CDC's Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases Department. \"The preliminary information reinforces our concern about the immediate threat to certain groups i Health Minister Alex Azar had previously said, \"The risk remains low. But that can change quickly.\" Azar added: \"We will see more cases.\"\nTwo previously confirmed cases in a nursing home in the state of Washington, as the responsible health officer Duchin said, caused particular concern. It was a member of the nursing staff and a woman about 70-year-old. In addition, many other nurses and patients complained about symptoms. \"I would not be practiced. \"It is an outstanding task to get a grip on an outbreak in an institution where so many vulnerable people are.\"\nOnly on Friday, because of the spread of the Coronavirus, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised the travel information for the whole of Italy to level three: no necessary travel should therefore be reconsidered. Trump's government had previously issued travel restrictions for China, which continue to apply. who had visited the country in the last 14 days.\nIn the USA until Friday, according to the health authority CDC, infections with Sars-CoV-2 had been detected in 15 people. Further 47 cases occurred in US citizens brought back to the United States from Japan or China. Trump announced to meet with representatives of pharmaceutical companies in the White House on Monday. Fae.\nTrump tried to play down the issue until now. The President repeatedly stressed that the US was prepared for the virus. Messonnier of the CDC had said on Tuesday that it was less a question of whether the virus would spread in the US, but rather when it would happen. Trump, on the other hand, had stressed on Wednesday that he thought e not that proliferation in the USA is inevitable.\nTrump is also trying to avoid further losses on the already hard-pressed stock markets through his remarks. The President is seeking his re-election in November and is particularly encouraging with the economic situation in the US.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday alerted Americans to begin preparing for the spread of coronavirus in the United States after infections surfaced in several more countries.\nThe announcement signaled a change in tone for the Atlanta-based U.S. health agency, which had largely been focused on efforts to stop the virus from entering the country and quarantining individuals traveling from China.\n\u201cThe data over the past week about the spread in other countries has raised our level of concern and expectation that we are going to have community spread here,\u201d Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the CDC\u2019s head of respiratory diseases, told reporters on a conference call.\nWhat is not known, she said, is when it will arrive and how severe a U.S. outbreak might be. \u201cDisruption to everyday life might be severe\u201d and businesses, schools and families should begin having discussions about the possible impact from the spread of the virus, Messonnier cautioned.\nIn a teleconference later on Tuesday, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC\u2019s principal deputy director, said that while the immediate risk in the United States was low, the current global situation suggested a pandemic was likely.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of if. It\u2019s a question of when and how many people will be infected,\u201d Schuchat said.\nIn San Francisco, California\u2019s fourth-largest city, officials declared a local emergency, despite having no coronavirus cases, in an effort to raise public awareness of the virus\u2019 risks and boost preparedness.\nSeparately, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar told a Senate subcommittee there will likely be more cases in the United States, and he asked lawmakers to approve $2.5 billion in funding to fight the outbreak after proposing cuts to the department\u2019s budget.\n\u201cWhile the immediate risk to individual members of the American public remains low, there is now community transmission in a number of countries, including outside of Asia, which is deeply concerning,\u201d Azar said, adding that recent outbreaks in Iran and Italy were particularly worrying.\nBelieved to have originated from illegal wildlife sold in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the new coronavirus has infected some 80,000 people and killed close to 2,700 in China.\nAlthough the World Health Organization says the epidemic has peaked in China, coronavirus cases have surfaced in about 30 other countries, with some three dozen deaths reported, according to a Reuters tally.\nGrowing outbreaks in Iran, Italy and South Korea have raised concerns that coronavirus will surface in other nations and worsen in those that have already reported infections, further denting a global economy that had already been hit by a dependence on China.\nGlobal and U.S. stock markets fell sharply again on Tuesday, as investors feared the epidemic would further damage an already slowing world economy.\nThe White House\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the U.S. economy would be able to ride out any disruption from the global spread of coronavirus, adding that he did not expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to blunt the disease\u2019s economic impact.\nU.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, however, said Republican President Donald Trump and his administration had been caught \u201cflat-footed\u201d and lacked a comprehensive plan to deal with the coronavirus. He called for at least $3.1 billion in additional funding to fight it.\n\u201cThe Trump administration has shown towering and dangerous incompetence when it comes to the coronavirus,\u201d said Schumer, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat. \u201cMr. President, you need to get your act together now.

The United States has said it was considering a range of responses to their expulsion.\n\u201cExpelling our journalists exposes once again the government\u2019s issue that led to SARS and now the coronavirus: namely censorship. It can have deadly consequences,\u201d Pompeo said, referring to the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which also emerged from China.\n\u201cIf China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge\u201d of coronavirus, he added.\nDespite the coronavirus epidemic, Pompeo said the United States still planned to host a special meeting with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Las Vegas in March.\n", "label": 1, "id": 1947}, {"content": "China reports 10 new deaths due to coronavirus, 'imported' cases rise to 111.

HONG KONG \u2014 Chinese officials hailed recent figures as evidence that the spread of the coronavirus epidemic has slowed, and World Health Organization (WHO) officials said Tuesday (Feb 18) that China\u2019s strict limits on its people\u2019s movements have helped. \n But the outbreak and its death toll continue to grow, the picture outside China has grown steadily more alarming, and experts caution against excessive optimism about the crisis peaking. \n \u201cIt could be unwise for anybody in China, or outside China, to be complacent that this is coming under control at this point in time,\u201d said Professor Malik Peiris, chief of virology at the University of Hong Kong. \n Researchers in Germany presented evidence Tuesday that people who have the new coronavirus can infect others even when they have no symptoms, as disease experts had suspected. Their findings, published in a letter in the New England Journal of Medicine, indicated that people may be spreading the epidemic before they know they are sick. \n But the Chinese government\u2019s daily tally of new infections and deaths from the virus has declined steadily since Feb 12. \n On Tuesday, authorities reported that in the previous 24 hours, 1,886 new cases had been confirmed \u2014 the first time since Jan. 30 that the number had dropped below 2,000 \u2014 and 98 patients had died. On Wednesday, the number of new infections reported by authorities was again below 2,000, with China recording 1,749 confirmed new cases of coronavirus infection, bringing the country\u2019s total number of reported infections to 74,185. \n With 136 deaths reported in Wednesday\u2019s figures, the total number in China of those confirmed to have died from the virus surpassed 2,000, reaching 2,004. \n Government officials, as well as public health experts around the world, said the numbers suggested that China\u2019s aggressive measures to contain the epidemic were working. China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping told Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain in a phone call Tuesday that China was making \u201cvisible progress\u201d in containing the epidemic, according to Chinese state media. \n More than half the country\u2019s population is under some limitations on its movements, and 150 million of its people face restrictions on leaving their homes, according to an analysis by The New York Times. \n \u201cRight now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,\u201d Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO\u2019s chief of emergency response, said Tuesday. \u201cYou can argue whether these measures are excessive or restrictive on people, but there is an awful lot at stake here in terms of public health \u2014 not only the public health of China but of all people in the world.\u201d \n China\u2019s lockdown has slowed the spread of the virus from its epicenter, the city of Wuhan, to the rest of China by two to three days, and from China to the rest of the world by two to three weeks, WHO officials said. \n The organization\u2019s endorsement of China\u2019s methods was an apparent reversal from less than three weeks earlier, when it had advised against restrictions on travel and trade. Some health experts have condemned the restrictions, saying that they were preventing vital resources from getting where they were needed, and could instill panic. \n Professor Zhong Nanshan, a renowned respiratory disease expert in China, said Monday that he expected the epidemic to peak in the country\u2019s southern regions by late February, and the rest of the country to follow soon after. \n But Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general said Monday that the apparent tapering of the spread in China \u201cmust be interpreted very cautiously,\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell if this reported decline will continue,\u201d he said during a news conference in Geneva. \u201cEvery scenario is still on the table.\u201d \n Since Chinese officials first acknowledged the virus in December, it has been hard to judge with precision the severity and scale of the outbreak. \n China has changed its criteria for diagnosis, prompting a large increase in reported infections and deaths last week. Tests for the virus have not been very accurate, and people who do not seek or receive medical care may not be not counted. And people with mild or no symptoms may not realize they have the virus and may not get counted. \n Initially, the cases reported outside mainland China were mostly among people who had recently visited there, but increasingly, they stem from contact in other countries. \n The number of cases in Jap\nan has spiked in recent days, most of them tied to a quarantined cruise ship that turned into a hotbed of transmission. Other case clusters have also turned up in Japan, but so far, the ship, the Diamond Princess, accounts for most of the cases worldwide outside of China \u2014 542 as of Tuesday, an increase of 88 in one day. \n On Monday, more than 300 American passengers on the ship were flown to the United States and placed in a two-week quarantine. Fourteen of them tested positive for the coronavirus shortly before leaving Japan, but were still allowed to board the flights. US officials had started the process of evacuating them home without knowing their test results. \n Some of those passengers said Tuesday they had been informed that a few more of them had tested positive for the virus since they arrived in the United States. \n Also on Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told more than 100 Americans who have been on the Diamond Princess they cannot return home for at least two more weeks, after it became clear that efforts to control the virus aboard the ship had been ineffective. The passengers include some who have tested positive for the virus and are hospitalized, and others still aboard the ship who have not shown signs of illness. \n Japanese officials said they expected 500 people to be let off the ship Wednesday. But they did not make it clear how they had concluded it was safe to release people, or how they had decided which passengers would leave, or who those people would be. \n Cambodia has allowed more than 1,000 passengers from another cruise ship, the Westerdam, to disembark without testing most of them. Hundreds of them flew out of the country, before one of them took ill and tested positive for the virus, raising fears of undetected cases and a further global spread. \n The country\u2019s authoritarian leader, Hun Sen, has continued to express complacency about the outbreak, even encouraging passengers from the Westerdam to go sightseeing in Cambodia. \n \u201cCruise ships are the weak link in the containment,\u201d said Professor Raina MacIntyre, an expert in biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Australia. Citing the potential for future cruise ships to harbor the virus, she said, \u201cwe could lose control of the epidemic if we don\u2019t get a tight handle on the cruise ship situation.\u201d \n There are other signs the outbreak\u2019s global toll has not crested. The first coronavirus-related death outside of Asia was announced Saturday, when a Chinese man died in France. Taiwan announced its first virus-related death Sunday, marking the fifth fatality outside mainland China. \n The economic cost of the outbreak, which has paralyzed China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, also continues to grow. \n On Tuesday, HSBC, the London-based bank with deep roots in Hong Kong, said that it would cut 35,000 jobs over the next three years, in part because of the coronavirus outbreak. \n President Moon Jae-in of South Korea warned Tuesday that the outbreak in China is creating an \u201cemergency\u201d for the economy, saying his country could be one of the hardest hit. \n If the virus starts to spread rapidly around the globe, it is unclear how other countries will respond. Few other governments have the power to clamp down as thoroughly as China, or even the desire. \n The lockdown in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak started, has taken a heavy human toll, making it difficult for many to find medical care or care for sick loved ones. The countrywide restrictions create their own challenges, stranding employees away from their jobs and pummeling the economy. \n \u201cThis is the issue,\u201d said Mr Peiris. \u201cIt is not clear that this is something that is replicable, even in other parts of China.\u201d \n It is a complicated calculation for China and the world. Though relaxed restrictions could revive the economy and ease fear and frustration, they could also lead to a resurgence of infections. \n In recent days, the Chinese authorities, hoping to nudge the economy back to life, have urged migrant laborers to return to work. Hundreds of millions had left urban centers for the Lunar New Year holiday in January. \n Officials in the Philippines said Tuesday that they would allow Filipino migrant workers to return to Hong Kong and Macau, reversing an earlier ban on travel to those regions.

NEW YORK - An old malaria treatment that has been tried with some success against the new coronavirus and was touted by U.S. President Donald Trump at a news briefing earlier on Thursday is in short supply as demand surges amid the fast-spreading outbreak.  \n The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), which maintains a list of drugs in shortage independent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's list, added the generic malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to its list on Thursday. Four out of eight manufacturers of the drug are currently in shortage, it said.  \n The new coronavirus, which causes the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness, emerged in December in Wuhan, China and has spread throughout the world.  \n There are currently no vaccines or treatments approved for the disease, but researchers are studying existing treatments and working on experimental ones. At the moment, most patients can only receive supportive care.  \n Erin Fox, senior director of drug information at University of Utah Health, who maintains ASHP's shortages list, said pharmacists are unable to get the drug or fill prescriptions in full.  \n Fox said that University of Utah's 12 retail pharmacies are not filling prescriptions for prophylactic use, and are preserving their stocks for inpatient needs.  \n The FDA could not be reached for comment, but hydroxychloroquine is not currently on its drugs in shortage list.  \n Trump called on U.S. health regulators to expedite potential therapies aimed at treating COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine.  \n \"We're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,\" Trump said of the malaria drug at a White House briefing.  \n  \n RUN ON PHARMACIES  \n Fox and the FDA have been watching for drug shortages that could be due to supply chain issues with manufacturing in China and India. But surging demand in recent weeks is the issue with the malaria drug, which can also treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, according to online pharmacy, Honeybee Health.  \n Its co-Chief Executive Jessica Nouhavandi sent a letter to prescribers earlier this week, urging them to be aware of potential hoarding of the drug that could deprives those who really need it.  \n On Thursday, Nouhavandi said demand was its highest yet after Trump's comments.  \n Jeff Bartone, who owns Hock's Pharmacy in Vandalia, Ohio, said he purchased five bottles of hydroxychloroquine this morning, but within an hour the company that distributes it to his pharmacy had run out.  \n He said four backup prescription drug wholesalers were out of the drug as well.  \n Bartone said he does not typically stock large amounts of the drug because it is not widely prescribed.  \n Mylan NV <MYL.O> - one of the manufacturers ASHP said was in shortage - said it was ramping up production of the drug and expects to be in a position to begin supplying it more broadly in mid-April.  \n It said with the raw materials on hand it can make 50 million tablets to potentially treat more than 1.5 million patients.  \n Bayer AG <BAYGn.DE> said it would donate 3 million tablets of Resochin - a closely related drug known generically as chloroquine phosphate. Chloroquine is also in shortage, according to the ASHP.  \n Online pharmacy Valisure said it too was unable to order any chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as of Thursday from its four distributors.  \n Valisure Chief Executive David Light said other potential treatments are also becoming difficult to obtain.  \n \"Kaletra and losartan are being rationed, meaning we are only allowed to order limited quantities at a time,\" he said.  \n Kaletra, a combination HIV treatment sold by AbbVie <ABBN.N>, and the generic blood pressure drug losartan have been considered as potential treatments for the virus, although Chinese investigators reported this week that Kaletra failed to improve outcomes for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.

The border of Hubei province, epicenter of the virus, opened on Wednesday after a two-month shutdown.\nBut there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation.\nAsymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious disease, making it harder to detect and stop transmission.\nIn China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000.\nChina had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday.\nAsymptomatic cases are currently found through \u201ccontact tracing\u201d.

Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest.\nThe Yale School of Public Health said the existence of presymptomatic (asymptomatic) patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries.\n\u201cThe real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,\u201d said Ian Henderson, Director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University.\n", "label": 0, "id": 1974}, {"content": "Coronavirus-hit China postpones annual Parliament session for 1st time in decades.

In January, the new Coronavirus was diagnosed in France, on which WeChat was posted. According to BBC, the woman had previously travelled to Lyon from the city of Wuhan, where the current outbreak began. Shortly after the post, the Chinese embassy in Paris reported to the French authorities.

The other two patients had also been to China before, it was said. What do the cases mean for Europe and Germany? How much do experts already know about the virus? And how is the situation in China developing?\nThe cases are the first in Europe, but they are no surprise. For days, experts have been assuming that the virus is coming to Europe. It is also considered likely that Germany will soon register the first cases brought in. But that's nothing to worry about. One reason for this assessment was that the director of the Robert Koch Institute told the Today Journal of the ZDF that \"outside China (...) so far there are no large chain infections\". And the European Anti-Fraud Office also said on Saturday:'European countries have the capacity to prevent and control an outbreak as soon as cases are discovered'.\nThe ECDC was founded only as a reaction to the Sars pandemic 2002/2003, i.e. as a reaction to a pandemic whose pathogen resembles the new Coronavirus. At that time, hundreds of people died worldwide, including Germany registered nine cases. In response to the Sars pandemic, most European countries also developed pandemic plans. Germany also has a national pandemic plan, which was last revised 2016. Every two years the pandemic case and the coordination between the federation and countries in exercises is tested.\nAnd so Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, emphasises to ZEIT ONLINE: \"We are very well prepared.\" In Hamburg, for example, the main actors, his institute, health offices and the Eppendorf University Clinic have been in close contact for days. The responsibilities were very clear.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. January wu\nThe first cases in France are known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nWhat could also help researchers is to understand the outbreak and the virus better, despite many gaps. The outbreak of the virus probably originated in a market in the 11-million-dollar town of Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, all kinds of wild animals such as snakes, foxes and pheasants are sold. From one of these animals, it could have been passed on to a human. On the other hand, it could have been transmitted by a bat, an analysis of the virus genomes (Biorxiv: Benvenuto et al., 2020) shows. This chain of infections is also unlikely because it resembles the Sars virus closely related to the new Coronavirus.\nHowever, it is now also clear that not all the infected were on the market. At the beginning of December, it appears that a patient has been infected elsewhere. This is shown by the data of Chinese doctors (The Lancet: Huang et al., 2020). Where exactly is unclear. Another animal reservoir or an infection from person to person is possible.\nIn general, it is now certain that the virus is effectively transmitted from person to person. The World Health Organization reported a chain of infections with four limbs, that is: one human infected himself at the animal source, then another human infected a third, who passed the virus on to a fourth. According to very preliminary estimates, an infected person is currently infecting 1,4 to 2,5 people. For comparison: a person who has measles has twelve people on average, a person who has the flu virus, two to three. According to previous knowledge, the new virus is therefore less infectious than the Sars agent. These figures, says the virologist Schmidt-Chanasit, are now rather a \"benchmark\" to assess how the epidemic is developing and what measures it needs.\nMedical practitioners also know more about the course of the virus disease. About a quarter of all cases were very difficult, the WHO said. After a first case report (New England Journal of Medicine: Zhu et al., 2020), The Lancet also published a study on the cases of illness in which data from forty-one patients from a hospital in Wuhan (Huang et al., 2020) were fed. It shows that most patients came to the hospital with fever and cough, one had diarrhoea. All patients had lungs that could be detected in the CT scan.\ninflammation. On average seven days after the first symptoms, the patients in the study were admitted to the hospital, after eight days their breath was short, and one day later lung failure followed.\nThe study also shows that some patients had heart problems. At every tenth an additional germ in the damaged pulmonary tissue was removed. Of the forty-one patients, six died, so about fifteen percent.\nIn a comment accompanying the study, however, doctors point out that many infected have few or no symptoms. It was therefore more likely that about three percent of the infected would die (The Lancet: Wang et al., 2020). But also this number, writers say, should be enjoyed with caution, because \"not all patients have left their illness behind (i.e., died or recovered) and the true number of patients is unknown.\"\nAccording to official information, around 1.300 people were diagnosed with the virus at the time of the appearance of this article. In order to stop the further spread, the Chinese authorities have taken various measures. They not only try to locate and quarantine contact persons of infected people, but also have a hospital with about 1.000 beds set up on the 3rd. February should be ready. Many experts consider China's response to the virus to be very rapid and praise the transparency of the authorities, especially compared to the Sars epidemic.\nThe Science Media Center in Germany, SMC, is a service for quality assurance in scientific journalism. It is supported by universities, research institutes, companies and the media. Journalists and journalists of the SMC provide free-of-charge information, scientific assessments of studies and quotes of researchers on current news, on topics from medicine and life sciences, the environment and climate, energy and mobility to all editorials.\nThe SMC's partners are the Science Press Conference (WPK) and the Klaus Tschira Foundation in Heidelberg. The SMC was founded in the year 2015 following the British model.\nHowever, there is also criticism of the latest measures: in recent days, China has sealed off entire cities by blocking roads, railway lines and airports in Wuhan and neighbouring major cities. Around 56 million Chinese in 22 cities have been affected by this.\nA lot of experts don't think that's a good idea. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of Global Health at Georgetown University, told the German Science Media Center: \"A containment of Wuhan will drive the epidemic underground and trigger fear and panic.\" In an epidemic, the exact opposite must be done, namely \"gain the trust of the community\". Only in this way would people work together, allowing authorities to track infection chains seamlessly, identify contact persons of infected people and quarantine them, and ultimately contain the epidemic.\nWith information from dpa\n", "label": 0, "id": 1978}, {"content": "Jerome Powell: \"I will not speculate on the coronavirus.

(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\nBy Clyde Russell\nLAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The spread across the world of the Chinese coronavirus has probably wiped out global crude oil demand growth for 2020, but in something of an irony it\u2019s likely to be China that will be responsible if any increase is eked out.\nThere is little doubt that the coronavirus, which started in the city of Wuhan and has killed more than 2,700 people so far, will hit Chinese crude consumption this month, and likely into March and April.\nBut it also seems to be the case that Beijing may finally be getting a handle on containing the virus, just as it ramps up in other countries, most notably South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy.\nThis makes it likely that Chinese refiners will be keen to resume operations that have been curtailed because of the virus, but this could be delayed until April.\nThere are two reasons for the delay in resuming full crude processing in China. Firstly, fuel inventories have to be drawn down and secondly March is traditionally a month when several refiners undertake scheduled maintenance, as it falls in the shoulder season between peak winter and summer demand.\nThere is also a difference between Chinese domestic fuel consumption, and the country\u2019s overall crude demand, given Beijing is still filling its strategic petroleum reserve, and refiners are also boosting exports of refined products.\nThis means that while some estimates suggested Chinese fuel demand fell by up to 4 million barrels per day (bpd) this month as the coronavirus led to the quarantining of entire cities, the hit to crude imports may not be so dramatic.\nChina\u2019s crude imports are expected at 10.53 million bpd for February, down from 10.69 million bpd in January, according to a report on Wednesday by Refinitiv Oil Research.\nA mere drop of 160,000 bpd isn\u2019t much of a dent to demand, and if the final tally is in line with the Refinitiv forecast, it will put some of the more doom-laden predictions about China\u2019s crude demand into perspective.\nHowever, it\u2019s likely that the bigger hit to China\u2019s oil imports will come in March, and possibly extend into April.\nRefinitiv vessel-tracking data is showing 136 vessels carrying 177.6 million barrels are already heading to China and expect to unload in March, already over half the expected deliveries in an average recent month.\nThis will also be far from the final total, given that more cargoes are likely to leave Middle Eastern and Russian ports in the next two weeks and still have time to reach China before the end of March.\nWhat the vessel-tracking and port data is suggesting is that while China\u2019s imports of crude may be softer than they would have been in the absence of the coronavirus, they are still holding up pretty well and the drop is nowhere near as severe as the hit to domestic fuel consumption.\nIf Chinese crude imports do start to recover from April onwards, it means the market focus is likely shift to how big the impact of the coronavirus will be on the rest of the world.\nWith more new cases being reported outside of China for the first time on Wednesday, the risks are rising that the coronavirus may reach vulnerable countries in Africa and the Middle East, and could strain health systems even in developed countries.\nIt\u2019s still a wait-and-see approach, but if travel bans and quarantine measures become commonplace across Europe, even forecasts for zero global oil demand this year may prove optimistic.\nHowever, the epidemic, along with fears that it may become a pandemic, is driving a slump in crude prices, with Brent futures dropping as low as $52.57 a barrel in early Asian trade on Thursday, the weakest intraday price in a year, and putting the decline since the peak this year on Jan. 8 to nearly 27%.\nAssuming China does contain the virus and its economy starts to recover as stimulus hopes are delivered, the current weak crude price may also drive increased buying for its strategic stockpiles.\n", "label": 1, "id": 1981}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Chinese return expected in Stuttgart.\nOn this Friday, the German Red Cross (DRC) is expecting more travellers from the Chinese town of Wuhan, which is particularly affected by the Coronavirus, in Stuttgart.\nThe DRC takes over the care on behalf of the federal government, said a spokesman for the relief organisation on Thursday in Berlin.

According to authorities, the persons concerned had not been outside their home town of Ghom. They also had no contact with Chinese tourists. According to the Ministry of Health, there are also three other proven infections in the country. All schools and universities in Ghom were provisionally closed, as reported by IRNA. The almost 1,2 million inhabitants of Ghom should avoid physical contact.\nMeanwhile, China has again changed the number of confirmed infections. As the Health Commission said, clinical diagnoses should no longer be included as confirmed cases in the statistics. The severely affected province of Hubei, where the virus had broken out, had only last week begun to count such diagnoses. Physicians determine the disease based on lung images and the physical condition. Now, once again, only DNA tests in the lab are to be considered.\nThe official statistics recorded until Thursday around 75.000 infections and more than 2100 deaths in the country. Experts, however, have long been expecting a much higher dark figure. Even a Chinese scientist is now questioning whether the epidemic can still be stopped and the virus disappears again. Covid-19 could become an established disease like the flu, said Wang Chen, president of the China Academy of Medical Science, on state television.\nAccording to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, two clinical trials are under way in China to treat patients.

In a scenario that is based on a relatively limited outbreak outside China, the OECD assumes a growth of two or four percent still- that is half a percentage point less than last predicted. In the previous year, the world economy had added two or nine percent.\nFor Germany, a plus is assumed for the gross domestic product of 0.3 percent, which are 0.1 points less than in November.

However, the male mortality rate is 2,8%, compared to 1,7% of women, reveals the New York Times.\nThe outbreak of viral pneumonia Covid-19, which has already affected at least 77 thousand people in China, causing 2400 fatalities,'is a crisis'and'huge proof' for the Chinese authorities, said the President of that country, in state television statements this Sunday.\nAccording to the same US newspaper, men were also most affected during outbreaks of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2002/2003; and MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) in the last five years.\nFor example, according to a study published in Annals of Internal Medicine magazine in Hong Kong in 2003, more women than men were infected by SARS, but the mortality rate among men was fifty% higher. As for MERS, death reached 32% of infected men and 25.8% of women. The New York Times goes up to 1918, pneumonic flu, known as Spanish flu, to confirm that then more men than women died.\nWhat makes men less resistant? \"We have seen this happen to other viruses. Women fight better against them than men,\" she begins by answering Sabra Klein, a researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Public Health School, who studies sexual differences in viral infections and vaccine reactions, adding that women also produce stronger immune responses after vaccination. Men have a harder time fighting infection.\nThe answer lies in the female immune system, which is more resistant, confirms Janine Clayton, from the National Health Institute and female health researcher, to the New York Times. But if it resists respiratory viruses better, the same cannot be said of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, in which women are more likely to get sick than men, he adds.\nFor the time being, there are no definitive answers as to why it is the immune system of women stronger than men, but one hypothesis has to do with female sex hormones, estrogens, which seem to contribute to strengthening the immune system, as well as the fact that they have two X chromosomes, while men have only one.\nExperiments with mice on the SARS coronavirus showed that males were more susceptible to infection, a difference that increased with age. They developed the disease with lower viral exposures than they did, just as they had greater lung damage. When the microbiology researchers at the University of Iowa, led by Stanley Perlman, blocked the estrogens in the infected females or removed the ovaries, they had a better chance of dying than the female mice that had not been intervened. So estrogens are supposed to play a protective role.\nBut there are other health and behavioural factors that may justify female resistance to viruses. For example, in China, the fact that men smoke more than women, they represent only 2% of a 316 million smokers, one third of the world's smokers, can help them not to resist the virus attacking the airway s o well.\nStill in that country, they have higher rates of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. They, a little around the world, have healthier living habits than they do, which can also contribute to their resistance.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nDownload the PUBLIC app, subscribe to our notifications and be aware of the evolution of the new coronavirus.\n", "label": 1, "id": 1988}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Portuguese quarantined have already left the hospital.

Several had known heart problems. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n Men in the China study were more likely to die than women by a margin of almost 3-to-2. \n But whether that was due to behaviour\u00a0\u2014 notably that most men in China smoke, while few women do\u00a0\u2014 or biological factors, such as hormonal differences, is still unknown. \n One striking finding from the China study is the near absence of cases among children.\u00a0 \n The 10-19 age bracket comprised one per cent of infections, and a single death. Children under 10 made up less than one per cent, with no deaths reported. \n \"We are still trying to wrap our heads around the deficit of cases among those under 20,\" Ms Cecile Viboud, an epidemiologist at the US National Institute of Health's Fogarty International Centre, told AFP in an interview. \n \"Is it because young children are less susceptible than adults, and thus simply don't get infected? Or if they do, that they have less disease?\" \n It is surprising infections of very young people are so low, she added, because they tend to be among the hardest hit by almost all respiratory infections\u00a0\u2014 whether viral or bacterial. \n HEROIC HEALTH WORKERS \n Mr David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, was also mystified. \n \"Where are the infected children???,\" he wrote in an email. \"This is critical\u00a0\u2014 perhaps kids are not being tested because they have mild symptoms.\" \n Another possible explanation is that children in China were out of school for the lunar new year holiday when the virus began to spread widely in January.\u00a0 \n \"But young children still live in households where they can be infected by their parents,\" Ms Viboud noted. \n A lower rate of infection among the youngest age groups was also seen during the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, but was less marked.\u00a0 \n Sars, which is also a coronavirus, broke out in Guangdong Province and killed 774 people out of 8,096 infected. \n The death of 34-year old Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang in early February, along with several more health workers in their twenties sparked speculation they had died because of repeated exposure, or even sheer exhaustion.\u00a0 \n Li's death sparked outrage in China because he had been muzzled by authorities for calling attention to the virus. \n Cellphone video images on social networks showed nurses and doctors, unable to cope with the caseload, breaking down in hysterics. \n \"A more likely reason why young clinicians are getting infected is because they were operating outside their level of expertise and training,\" Mr John Nichols, a professor in the department of pathology at the University of Hong Kong, told AFP. \n \"It is noble that the junior doctors pony up valiantly to help, but they most likely would not have had the necessary training in handling infectious patients.\" \n The larger question of just how lethal COVID-19 is, remains unanswered. \n 'SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE' \n The ratio of confirmed cases to deaths suggests a mortality rate of 3.4 percent, but several studies have concluded that up to two-thirds of infections in China and elsewhere have gone undetected, which would make the virus far less deadly. \n \"At the moment, we don't have a good understanding of the real mortality rate,\" Ms Sharon Lewin, director of the Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne told Australian television.\u00a0 \n \"It is estimated at about two percent.\" \n With SARS\u00a0\u2014 which killed nearly one in 10 pa\ntients\u00a0\u2014 early mortality figures turned out to be underestimates, in part because victims of the virus did not die quickly. \n With the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, however, the opposite happened, said Ms Viboud. \n \"Within a few weeks of the outbreak, the mortality estimate declined first 10-fold, and then 100-fold, as we moved from severe pneumonia to getting all flu cases.\" \n \"Here, I think we are somewhere in the middle,\" she added, saying the current two per cent mortality estimate could well decline. \n The seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1 percent but is highly infectious, with up to 400,000 people worldwide dying from it each year. \n The China CDC study showed that COVID-19 was \"mild\" for more than 80 per cent of confirmed cases.

Many young people from schools and colleges have also expressed their curiosity, wondering about the impact of the virus on their lives and dwelling on ways they can stay safe.\nChildren and youngsters are contemplating whether Covid-19 is man-made or if it has been manufactured by some vested interests to harm people. They are also wondering whether it is safe to travel amidst the outbreak.\nThere is a lot of responsibility on teachers at this crucial time. They need to stay positive and also provide facts about the virus to their students such as how it spreads, ways to stay protected, etc. Teachers can corroborate information being provided by news channels, assuage baseless fears and answer queries as factually as possible.\nHere are 7 tips to help you educate students and children about Coronavirus facts without alarming them:\nThe number of coronavirus cases is in the rise in different parts of the world. The first confirmed case of coronavirus in India was reported from the state of Kerala on January 30, 2020.\nSince then, seventy-three cases have been reported in the country. Kerala\u2019s schools and movie halls have been shutdown to prevent the spread of the virus.\nTeachers can empower students with information about the symptoms which includes fever, coughs and shortness of breath. In the most severe cases, individuals can also suffer from organ failure.\nTeachers should tell students that in case they have not bought masks, which is a compulsory thing at per the state of mind for many people there is no need to worry.\nAccording to experts, only people who have been infected with the virus and others who are caring for the affected individuals need to wear masks.\nA good practice to keep coronavirus and other infections at bay is to wash hands properly, preferably with warm water and soap for 20 seconds.\nIn case soap and water is not available, one can also use hand sanitizers containing at least 60 percent alcohol to effectively kill viruses and bacteria.\nThe young individuals wanting to stay safe can easily carry a bottle of sanitizer with them.\nThe teachers/ school authorities can take it upon themselves to ensure cleaning of surfaces such as door handles, stair rails, etc. which are used by many people regularly to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nAccording to experts, this is necessary as the virus tends to survive on these surfaces for a few hours to several days.\nTeachers can explain to the students that a few conspiracy theories doing the rounds are not true and the coronavirus is definitely not man-made. These viruses exist in the environment naturally and infect humans occasionally.\nCoronavirus is quite similar to SARS and MERS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome), both of which have passed from animals to humans.\nTeachers can share the following list with students to help them contain the virus:\nThe teachers can do all this to create awareness in students about Covid-19 without alarming them about the virus. However, the risk levels should not be over prioritized in these discussions.\nMoreover, the students should also know about the immediate action plan of hospitals, once a case is detected.\nPreventive measures for controlling the coronavirus include setting up of isolation wards in hospitals and proper screening of people arriving in India from affected areas.\n Coordination among governments is another step taken to keep the situation in control.\n", "label": 1, "id": 1995}, {"content": "Number of deaths caused by the new coronavirus rises to 17.

On Friday, Spanish, Danish and Norwegian citizens evacuated from China due to Wuhan 2019-ncov coronavirus will arrive in Madrid for 14 days of isolation at the military hospital in Gomez ula, the capital. As pointed out by Bethlehem Padilla, associate doctor of clinical microbiology and infectious disease services at the Gregorio Maranon hospital and vice president of the Madrid School of medicine, isolation for two weeks can only be preventive because they have no symptoms: \"They're not sick. They're those who are in areas infected with coronavirus but have no symptoms. Isolation is just for surveillance.\"\nEnrique Ruiz Escudero, a health consultant, also stressed this point: \"they are neither regarded as patients nor as patients. They are in the region, so they may be candidates, but that's all. They have no symptoms, and if they have any symptoms, they can't travel. He explained by telephone that when they arrived in Madrid, they would undergo another examination, and then they would be \"normally hospitalized to pass preventive isolation\".\nA few hours ago, in preparation for the visit, the World Health Organization (who) emergency committee declared the outbreak an international emergency to launch \"global action\" At the community level, the health consultant developed an agreement and sent an agreement to all hospitals in the region to deal with patients suspected of being infected with the virus. Dr. Padilla explained why.\nIs there a risk of infection in Madrid?\nThe current risk is zero because there are no cases in Spain. Although it looks like a highly infectious virus (it has spread rapidly), it can occur only when it reaches that specific area of China or comes into contact with people who do so. But today the risk is zero.\nAre precautions recommended?\nAt present, we just need to wait for new information from the Ministry of health and follow its recommendations and those issued by the Madrid community. We don't have to go to the drugstore to buy masks or use alcohol hand sanitizer everywhere. For example, instead of coughing on your hands, cough on your handkerchief and throw it away, or cough on your elbows.\nHow is Madrid prepared to respond to the arrival of these evacuees?\nPublic health in Spain and Madrid is very good, microbiology services are very good, and there are large hospitals where virus testing can be carried out if necessary, although it is officially confirmed that any doubt is from the European community. National Institute of Microbiology (CNM), Majadahonda.\nIf a case appears in the community?\nWe have two isolated hospitals, Carlos III hospital in La Paz and Gomez ula military hospital. The patients may be there. So far, this virus has not been treated, nor have many other viruses. What they need is good support measures. The hospital is establishing multidisciplinary teams to implement the measures of the Madrid community protocol. These teams are composed of doctors in the emergency department, prevention department, microbiology, infection department and intensive care unit.\nThe agreement mentioned by Dr. Padilla sets out guidelines for dealing with potential cases when symptoms listed by the Ministry of health in a document appear. \uff08a\uff09 The most common are cough, sore throat, fever and shortness of breath. In more serious cases, infection can lead to pneumonia, severe dyspnea, renal failure and even death. The most serious cases usually occur in the elderly or people with other diseases such as heart disease. Although it is not clear how this infection occurs, the most accepted method is through\nWater droplets that may be discharged during contact and cough.\nThis article introduces the \"first contact with patients in the hospital emergency room\". It is necessary to ask whether you went to Hubei Province, China within 14 days before the onset of symptoms, or whether you have been exposed to confirmed or possible cases of 2019-ncov. If the answer is yes, the first part of the agreement will begin, including wearing surgical masks for patients and entourage, and isolating them in personal habits for appropriate testing.\nIf the suspicion is confirmed, the public health department must be informed immediately, and the necessary samples must be taken and sent to the National Microbiology Center (which should report the results within less than 24 hours). At the same time, the patient must continue to be isolated until the results come out.\nIn addition, \"if the patient's clinical condition meets the severity criteria before waiting for the diagnosis results of CNM laboratory, with the approval of the public health department, the patient can be transferred to the reference hospital: Carlos III hospital in La Paz,\" the consultation document explained. In this case, \"the Ministry of public health will communicate with La Paz Carlos III hospital and contact SAMA 112 to transfer patients\".\nHealth advisers believe that providing information and providing information responsibly is crucial: \"we must stay on the sidelines, yes, but stay calm. We must raise people's awareness of reality. Now, today, people are not at any risk.\" If this happens at any time, the region is \"completely ready\". He explained that on Thursday, together with the Ministry of health, he updated the latest information on primary health care and hospital and suspicious patient management: \"Whether in epidemiology or nursing, it is planned and clear: the route and process of patients and staff...\"\nWith more knowledge of the virus, experts estimate that the mortality rate of the virus is between 2% and 3%. Compared with similar viruses available so far, the mortality rate is low, and the scheme will be changed if necessary. E has held three meetings, composed of a wide range of experts who need to be \"closely coordinated\" with the Department.

The spread of a new coronavirus in mainland China and to 27 countries and regions beyond is alarming health experts. Here is what we know - and do not know - about the virus:  \n  \n HOW DANGEROUS IS THE VIRUS?  \n The coronavirus family of viruses includes the common cold and more serious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).  \n Many of those with the new virus who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems.  \n Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough and breathing difficulties.  \n Statistics from China indicate that about 2% of peopleinfected with the new virus have died, suggesting it may be deadlier than seasonal flu but less deadly than SARS, which killed about 10% of infected individuals. The MERS outbreak in 2012 had a fatality rate of about 35%.  \n Scientists have labelled the new virus 2019-nCoV.  \n  \n HOW IS IT TRANSMITTED AND HOW CAN IT BE PREVENTED?  \n The virus can be transmitted via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes, and can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles.  \n Experts have said it is more easily transmitted than the SARS virus. The incubation period is up to 14 days. People may be able to infect others before symptoms appear.  \n The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people frequently wash hands, cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.  \n  \n DO FACE MASKS HELP?  \n \"We recommend the use of masks for people who have symptoms ... because the virus transmits through droplets,\" says medical expert Sylvie Briand.  \n But they do not guarantee protection against infection.  \n \"For people who don't have symptoms, the mask in fact is not useful,\" Briand says.  \n The American Centers for Disease Control's advice is that face masks are not required for the general public.  \n  \n IS THERE ANY TREATMENT?  \n There is no vaccine.  \n Chinese scientists were able to identify the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus and shared it publicly. Scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version ofthe virus, a step toward creating a vaccine.  \n Drugmakers around the globe expect to begin testing experimental vaccines on humans in about three months.  \n  \n WHERE HAS IT SPREAD?  \n About 99% of the more than 20,000 cases have been reported in mainland China. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in about 27 other countries and regions, a Reuters tally based on official statements shows.  \n At least 490 people have died in China, most in and around the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines, both following visits to Wuhan.  \n Singapore confirmed four more coronavirus cases on Feb. 5 taking its tally to 28. Thailand has 25 cases.  \n It took the new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first1,000 people. It took SARS 130 days to infect 1,000 people. Ittook MERS 2.5 years to infect 1,000 people.  \n  \n WHAT ARE AUTHORITIES DOING?  \n The Chinese government has virtually locked down the centralprovince of Hubei, home to 60 million people, and its capital Wuhan.  \n China is facing mounting isolation as airlines suspendflights to its cities.  \n The United States and Australia have banned entry to foreignnationals who have recently travelled to China.  \n Many countries have evacuated their citizens from Hubei and are putting them in quarantine or isolation upon return.  \n The WHO has not recommended travel or trade curbs with China.  \n  \n WHERE DID THE VIRUS COME FROM?  \n It is believed to have originated in a food market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species.  \n  \n Genetics of the new virus https://tmsnrt.rs/2vAU9KZ  \n  \n  \n (Compiled by Reuters staff) REUTERS\n", "label": 1, "id": 2001}, {"content": "Backstory - 'This is a special time': Reporting from the edge of China's virus lockdown.

If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\nThis was what legendary Chinese strategist Sun Tzu said in his the Art of War in the times when Gautam Buddha was preaching good ways of life in India.\nNow replace the word 'enemy' in the opening paragraph with novel coronavirus and read the three sentences again. This new enemy has emerged from China and brought the whole world to its knees. It needs to be fought with full might.\nThis fact cannot be overstated that the world - as individuals, agencies and the governments - needs to have full clarity about novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, a disease that turns certain existing ailments into killer ones.\nNovel coronavirus itself is not a new virus. It is believed to have been living peacefully in its host, bats, the mammal cousins of humans. Some time in November last year, this novel coronavirus - now officially named SARS-CoV-2 or sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 - made the journey from bats through some intermediary animal to humans in Chinese business hub of Wuhan.\nNow, novel coronavirus is a human virus. And, it is a new virus for human body. The novel coronavirus being new means the body does not know the mechanism how to fight this unknown enemy. It also means there is no readily available medicine to nutralise novel coronavirus in human body.\nMedical science, the unique power of well-being, is using all its skills and might to come out with a solution. Now, there is at least some understanding about how this new virus behaves.\nAccording to a newly published paper, the novel coronavirus lives longer on some surfaces such as plastic and steel more than other, say cardboard or copper. Knowing stability of novel coronavirus is important to understand its virility or its ability to infect a healthy person.\nBut on a copper surface, no viable novel coronavirus could be found during the study after four hours. This means copper utensils and door knobs are safer than those made up of plastic or steel.\nOn cardboards used for packaging most of the items we order online, the novel coronavirus does not stay viable for more than 24 hours. This means your online orders in most cases are safe unless the delivery boy had the infection and sneezed on it.\nSome other studies have found that novel coronavirus remains suspended in air in the form of droplets - called aerosols -- formed through sneezing and coughing. The usual time of suspension is about 30 minutes. But they can stay suspended for up to two hours. Gravity brings them down and the chances of the novel coronavirus trapped inside those droplets entering a human's respiratory tract get reduced to minimum this way.\nHowever, in some cases, the novel coronavirus containing aerosols have travelled up to the ventilator of isolation wards of the Covid-19 patients. This is against the hitherto held view that novel coronavirus does not travel through air.\nTo believe that novel coronavirus does not travel through air and start falling could be misleading. This puts health workers at greater risk if they are attending to novel coronavirus patients.\nThis also means healthy people visiting hospitals without adequate protective gear are at the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus and become a vector of Covid-19 even if they don't immediately show symptoms.\nTo put it in simpler words, it is important to remember that touch is not the only way to get infected by novel coronavirus. Since people cannot stay long without breathing, visiting such places where novel coronavirus laden aerosols are suspended, falling or travelling in air can make a healthy person a Covid-19 patient.\nThe good part is that the scientists working on the novel coronavirus have found that the contagion in such aerosols loses its ability to infect very fast. And, even a 10-minute time lag reduces the chances of spread significantly.\nAvoiding this enemy is the key. With Scientists working to know novel coronavirus more and more every day, this knowledge is the weapon to protect oneself and let the virus die its own death.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2005}, {"content": "china's new covid-19 cases rise on infections from abroad.

The world is not connected only through the Internet but also through its markets. The global markets operate in a chain with China forming the second biggest block of the economic chain. And, China is currently on a massive lockdown in one of its key provinces, Hubei to contain coronavirus outbreak. Hubei's capital, Wuhan is the transport hub in China earning the name of \"thoroughfare of China\". All transport is stationed till further orders here.\nChina is the second biggest economy of the world. Any fluctuation in the GDP growth rate projection in China's economy is bound to impact the global slowdown. India's struggle to reverse the sliding GDP growth rate is already a global worry. The coronavirus outbreak has aggravated the headache of global economy watchers and managers.\nSome observers are already citing impact of past epidemic/pandemic outbreaks on world economy. In 2002-03, China was bogged down by SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) which had a higher fatality rate than the current Wuhan virus, as the current strand of coronavirus has been named.\nEstimates suggest that the SARS outbreak impacted China's GDP growth rate by 1.1 to 2.6 percentage point. A similar impact of the Wuhan virus outbreak would be devastating for global economy at this point. China's and the world's economy was less interconnected and interdependent on one another back in 2002-03.\nThe impact of coronavirus outbreak is already being felt across the globe in stock exchanges. China's Shenzhen and Shanghai composite stock market indexes fell 3.52 per cent and 2.75 per cent respectively before closing for the Lunar New Year break. The break has been extended till the next Monday in an attempt to wrest the negative sentiments on the markets.\nStock exchanges in Japan, the US and Europe have witnessed similar sentiments. In India, the BSE Sensex fell by over 1 per cent on Monday and rupee weakened to hit a near three-week low against US dollar.\nLunar New Year is a vacation and travel time in China. Reports say that over 70 lakh people had made travel plans for abroad. But actual travel is estimated to have come down by 40 per cent compared to 2019.\nThe transport shutdown on massive scale in China has impacted the industry badly and affected import- export sector as well. China is currently the manufacturing hub of the world. Any prolonged clampdown on transport is bound to create ripple effect in other parts of the globe.\nThe full impact of Wuhan virus on China's and the global economy will be known only after the coronavirus spread has been contained fully and normal business restored. But early estimates say the coronavirus outbreak may cost China's economic growth by 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent. At 1 per cent, loss to Chinese economy will be over $136 billion. And, this is huge.\nAccording to the Asian Development Bank, the SARS outbreak had caused a loss of $18 billion. The full scale global impact of the corronavirus impact would be much greater. Human impact, with more than 35 million people in lockdown state and threatened by the same virus, could be even greater.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2017}, {"content": "chinese military scientists ordered to win global race to develop coronavirus vaccine. BEIJING \u2014 The Chinese military has been ordered to join the race to develop the world\u2019s first vaccine for Covid-19, according to military and scientific sources. \n The state broadcaster CCTV reported on Tuesday (March 17) that a research team led by Major General Chen Wei, a top epidemiologist and virologist with the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), had been authorised to start a clinical trial. \n CCTV described the vaccine being developed by Dr Chen\u2019s team alongside Tianjin-based CanSino Biologics as the front-runner among nine possible treatments being worked on by Chinese scientists. \n Researchers around the world are scrambling to develop a vaccine for the disease, and one expert said the Chinese leadership would feel they had \u201clost face\u201d if the Americans beat them to it. \n The start of the Chinese trial follows the news that the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Moderna have recruited 45 \u201chealthy adult volunteers\u201d, ages 18 to 55, to test a vaccine that copies the genetic code of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. \n \u201cChina\u2019s announcement of a clinical trial came a little bit earlier than I had expected, even though I believe the first dose of the recombinant vaccine has already been injected into Dr Chen\u2019s body and some of her teammates,\u201d Dr Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based vaccine expert, said. \n Dr Tao was referring to photos that have been circulating on the social media platform WeChat that showed Dr Chen being injected with a possible vaccine. \n Dr Chen, 54 specialises in the development of recombinant vaccines \u2013 which use a harmless virus or bacterium to introduce the pathogen\u2019s genetic material into the body to build up immunity \u2013 and has been credited with helping develop treatments during the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak. \n She also developed a nasal spray to protect medical workers during the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). \n The Chinese military has also been helping to tackle the medical emergency in Hubei, the province at the centre of the outbreak, with more than 10,000 personnel being deployed. \n The People\u2019s Liberation Army has also been given more power than local governments to control medical supplies, a sign of the central government\u2019s determination to contain the spread of the virus. \n But two military sources said the Central Military Commission had also been pressuring military medical scientists to develop a vaccine. \n \u201cThe CMC has kept calling the AMMS every day to push the vaccine development over the past few weeks,\u201d one source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said. \n On Tuesday, vaccine producer CanSino Biologic said it had started looking for volunteers to take part in a six-month clinical trial of the treatment it was developing with the academy. \n Dr Tao, who previously worked for the Shanghai Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for 14 years, said the military labs had advantages in recruiting volunteers for trials. \n \u201cA clinical trial may need to take several months or even a year, which needs close cooperation between labs and volunteers. Military officers are easier to manage because of their dedication,\u201d Dr Tao said. \n A Beijing-based retired military historian said the CMC was pushing the academy hard to develop the vaccine as quickly as possible. \n \u201cThey need to run human tests earlier, because it is the only short-cut,\u201d the historian, who requested anonymity, said. \n \u201cAll the AMMS lab staff used to joke that they are \u2018lab rats\u2019. They are the first human beings to test those expensive imported vaccines for senior officials.\u201d \n Dr Tao said the top Chinese leadership expected PLA virologists to develop the world\u2019s first coronavirus vaccine and would feel they had \u201clost face\u201d if other countries beat them to it. \n No vaccine was ever developed for Sars, which was caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that leads to Covid-19. \n \u201cChinese virologists once had an opportunity during the Sars outbreak, but they missed out that time. Now Dr Chen and her team feel they have a mission to complete the vaccine research.\u201d \n The US military is also working with civilian labs to develop a treatment. \n At the start of the month, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said the biological defence lab at Fort Detrick in Maryland was involved in the project to develo\np a vaccine. \n Another US military lab, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, is also joining the vaccine research, according to the defence news website military.com.

Nearly 230 cases have been reported in some 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally based on official statements shows.  \n The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus - officially called 2019-nCoV - a global emergency and says facemasks are important in curbing transmission if someone is showing symptoms. Pregnant women may be able to pas\ns it to their unborn children, according to Chinese state media.  \n Asked about various reports of \"drug breakthroughs\", WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV.\"  \n Russia said it would take between eight and 10 months to develop a vaccine, Interfax reported. Scores of Russians began two weeks of quarantine in Siberia on Wednesday after being flown from Wuhan.  \n Beijing has criticised as an overreaction U.S. travel curbs that bar foreign nationals who have visited China.

LONDON - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (https://www.reuters.com/live-events/coronavirus-6-id2921484) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:  \n  \n * Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.  \n * Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.  \n * COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.  \n * A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.  \n * They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.  \n * Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.  \n * The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was \"too early\" to speak of a pandemic.  \n * Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.  \n * Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with \"crown\"-like spikes.  \n * Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.  \n * Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a \"recombinant\" virus strain.

SHANGHAI (BLOOMBERG) - The coronavirus epidemic is accelerating a shake-out in China's property sector as a cash crunch forces distressed developers to throw in the towel. \n With lockdowns across the world's most-populous nation entering their third month, smaller home builders are being pushed to the brink because they can't get enough money from pre-sales of apartments to cover their costs. \n In the first two months of this year, around 105 real estate firms issued bankruptcy filing statements, after almost 500 collapses in 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \n \"A vast number of mid- to small-sized developers will face a choice no one wants to make - either sell their property assets and start another business, or be bought out,\" China Index Holdings Research Director Huang Yu said. \n \"The shake-out is just beginning.\" \n Even before the new coronavirus, China's housing market was under pressure. \n Home prices rose at the slowest pace in almost two years in January and several developers, saddled with debt they're struggling to service, began to dial back on construction. S&P Global Ratings said in a note on Tuesday (March 10) that as Covid-19 spreads, the squeeze may be felt most acutely by Chinese banks and property firms. \n As a result, mergers and acquisitions among the nation's almost 100,000 real estate companies will ramp up again in 2020, Mr Yu said, declining to put a number on the expected deal value. \n \"Declining sales will hurt developers' liquidity, as the proceeds still form the largest and most important funding source,\" S&P credit analyst Christopher Yip said, noting that with construction largely paused, delivery schedules and revenue recognition are being pushed further out. \n \"Several companies already in the CCC category or with low ratings with negative outlooks may face liquidity issues.\" \n New York-based Avenue Capital Group, a firm that trades distressed debt and invests in special situations, said a China home market in flux spells increasingly versatile buying opportunities. It's looking at scooping up soured developer debt and buying troubled real estate projects at a discount. \n \"There'll be more bargains appearing on the market,\" said Wang Yifeng, Avenue Capital's Shanghai-based head of China. \"If you see a distressed seller among the country's top 100 firms, don't be surprised.\" \n Construction Halted According to S&P, new home sales in China will register their first drop in 12 years this year, with transactions down as much as 15 per cent. That's if the virus reaches a turning point this month. If the nadir isn't until April, sales could be down around 20 per cent, akin to the hit taken during the 2008 global financial crisis. \n Fusheng Group\u00a0is one of the first mid-sized developers to falter. The debt-laden company, based in China's southeastern Fujian province, was in talks to sell a 70 per cent stake to a consortium led by Shimao Property Holdings, people familiar with the matter said in December. \n Local media reported in January that a new joint venture has been established, with Fusheng injecting its jettisoned property projects into the fresh vehicle. Shimao is one of the nation's biggest developers. \n Representatives from Fusheng didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. \n Cash flows of less competent players have been sliding for years and the virus is only making matters worse, according to Wu Rui, an executive director of non-performing assets at private equity firm CDH Investments Fund Management Co.\u00a0Asset-management companies are teaming up with top developers and eyeing such businesses, he said. \n In Hubei alone, the epicentre of the virus, there are around 4,300 developers. Home prices in Hubei's provincial city Wuhan rose at one of the fastest paces in the world last year, Knight Frank data show. \n To the north, in central Henan province, the general manager of one small developer said the only target his company had set, in early February, was to make all of its debt repayments over the next six months. \n Another manager at a small developer based in Zhejiang, a province in China's east, said the firm was two months away from bankruptcy. Its four projects under construction are halted because of the virus, he said. \n \"The epidemic could actually be a fresh opportunity for big developers,\" said Liu Ce, who's in charge of growth strategy at another large homebuilder, Shenzhen-based Ka\nisa Group Holdings. \n \"We can pull many levers to alleviate cash flow stress. Once you live through that, you see the wave of asset offloading by small players as a good chance.\" \n Kaisa became the first, and only, Chinese developer to default on its US dollar debt in April 2015. It went through a huge debt restructure and spent years rebuilding its balance sheet and credit rating. \n Now, it's regained investor confidence; Kaisa has already sold US$1.2 billion (S$1.67 billion) of bonds this year and in January, bought a site in Hong Kong's New Territories for HK$3.5 billion (S$630 million) to expand its foothold in the city. \n But while the likes of Kaisa, Shimao and China Evergrande Group have hundreds of property projects nationwide, the majority of China's developers are small and unlisted, with sometimes just a handful of projects in one city. They're the ones most at risk from the twin forces of coronavirus and a slowing market. \n Smaller developers also typically do not rely on bank loans or bond sales to alleviate funding concerns. Instead, they count on inflows from apartment sales, as well as shadow financing. \n Policymakers have so far refrained from unleashing wholesale monetary stimulus measures for real estate firms, fearing that could result in a surge in home prices. Most support has come from marginal easing by local governments. The central bank reiterated earlier this month that real estate \"definitely\" won't be used to stimulate the economy. \n Shenzhen on Wednesday allowed builders to draw on some cash deposits, which are usually held in reserve by banks during construction to ensure developers don't abandon projects. Still, local officials stressed the current home-buying restrictions won't be loosened. \n Coronavirus may be the \"straw that broke the camel's back for many small builders\", said Xie Yangchun, an analyst at China Real Estate Information Corp. \n \"A new wave of industry consolidation has started.\"\n", "label": 1, "id": 2039}, {"content": "Everyone is talking about coronavirus pneumonia, but what about those who kill 2000 children every day? The world is in an emergency caused by pneumonia. No, I'm not just talking about the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China. When public health authorities try to control the dangerous SARS virus pathogen ncov2019, child pneumonia is now the biggest infectious killer of children, with one death every 39 seconds. Nevertheless, the response of the international community to this emergency is only a collective shrug.\nPerhaps this is because most people believe that pneumonia is a threat to the elderly first, which is true. This view is reinforced by the death of coronavirus through severe acute respiratory infection. Most of the victims are elderly people with health conditions. However, pneumonia is now the main cause of infectious death in children, killing more than 800000 people every year. Most of the victims were under 2 years old. Almost all deaths occur in the poorest countries in the world.\nNo statistics can capture that the core of this emergency is human tragedy. Caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, a disease that attacks the air sacs of the lungs, causing the lungs to swell and fill with pus. It's really hard for children to breathe.\nThe good news is that childhood pneumonia can be overcome. Effective pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) can prevent non viral cases. The global alliance for vaccines and immunization (GAVI) has funded the vaccination of more than 120 million children. Most cases can be successfully treated with basic antibiotics at a cost of less than 45 cents. Even the most severe cases can be treated with higher levels of antibiotics and medical oxygen. A recent study in a Nigerian hospital found that combining medical oxygen with a diagnostic instrument called pulse oximeter could reduce mortality by half.\nNow it's bad news. Although the number of deaths from infant pneumonia is declining, it is slower than other major killers such as malaria and measles. Five years ago, governments signed the commitment to the sustainable development goal of \"ending preventable child deaths\" by 2030. If the current trend continues, pneumonia will turn this commitment into (another) unfulfilled commitment, further weakening the already fragile credibility of governments, donors and international sustainable development goal implementing agencies.\nSo why is there so little action and international cooperation from the world's largest child killer? As I discussed with Devi Sridhar, Professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh in another space, the victim's personal data is part of the explanation.\nPneumonia with malnutrition as the main risk factor is the ultimate disease of poverty. Those most at risk - the rural poor and urban slum dwellers - have no voice in the priorities of the health agenda. Although the poorest children face the greatest risk, they are the least likely to be vaccinated, and the last one on the treatment list is the most likely to be misdiagnosed.\nPneumonia can check the fairness of the health system. When symptoms of the disease appear, the poorest families tend to postpone treatment because they are worried about costs or because the nearest clinic is far away. In many cases, clinics lack the trained personnel and diagnostic equipment needed to provide effective treatment.\nThere are some encouraging signs that inertia is making way for action. This week, governments, donors, researchers, United Nations agencies and civil society organizations held the first global children's pneumonia forum in Barcelona. Its purpose is to share evidence and, more importantly, to promote\nAnd an action plan to translate this evidence into life-saving policies. A new alliance for change is emerging, led by the \"count per breath\" alliance.\nOne of the obstacles to effective action against pneumonia is the growing anachronism of the debate between advocates of \"vertical\" or disease-specific interventions and \"horizontal\" approaches aimed at strengthening health systems. The substantive issues involved are real. Donors often make horizontal statements emphasizing their commitment to strengthening health systems, but then allocate resources to targeted disease interventions, distorting health priorities. While the world bank praises the advantages of strengthening health systems, its funds are mainly used for vertical interventions.\nSimilarly, health systems must respond to diseases that affect the poor. It is a fiction that countries can realize the Holy Grail of universal health insurance without solving diseases such as pneumonia and breaking the link between malnutrition and broader health risks. Entry points for effective action are primary health care and support to community health workers. Shifting resources to higher-level facilities that the poor cannot afford will only have a trickle down effect.\nCoronavirus provides a painful but timely reminder that we are members of a human community. In our interconnected world, an epidemic starting in Wuhan may pose a threat to the health of Mumbai to New York in a few weeks. Multilateralism and international cooperation are our only defence.\nBut arguments in favour of multilateral action have not stopped with the cross-border epidemic affecting the public in rich countries. Today, pneumonia will kill more than 2000 children. This is a health emergency and we can stop it.\nKevin Watkins is the director general of save the Children UK.

NEW YORK \u2014 Ms Yardley Wong, captive on the Japanese cruise ship grappling with the coronavirus, captured in a single image the essence of life under quarantine. From inside her tiny cabin, Ms Wong took a picture of the closed doorway. She posted it to Twitter last week. \n \u201cSo much wondering through this door,\u201d she wrote. \n From the Black Plague to the flu pandemic of 1918 to more recent outbreaks, the history of quarantine and medical isolation shows common emotional threads of those on both sides of such doors \u2014 uncertainty, terror, loneliness, separation. But this time, the raw physical barrier is showing cracks, thanks to the smartphone. \n \u201cAfter some emotional breakdown, I find my peace from you all,\u201d Ms Wong tweeted several days after her post brought messages of support from people around the world. \u201cThank you for the kindness. Your tweets give me strength.\u201d \n While newspapers, radio and television have softened the ordeal of past sequestrations, the coronavirus quarantines of 2020 are unlike any other in human history owing to almost universal digital connection. \n So much wondering through this door. #coronaviru #Quarantine #diamondprincess #outbreak #japan #yokohama #fight #BeStrong pic.twitter.com/2O7e1Fcxle \n Laptops, tablets and smartphones are allowing people in quarantine to work at their jobs remotely, order food, shop on Amazon, chat face-to-face with friends and loved ones, keep up with social media feeds, download movies and music \u2014 in short, to stay engaged in the world and fulfill many activities of their regular lives. \n Ms Karey Maniscalco, an American real estate agent who was quarantined with her husband, Roger, on the same cruise ship, found isolation surprisingly busy. \u201cThe last couple of days, we\u2019ve been just catching up on work online and doing a lot of Facebooking,\u201d she said in an interview last week, before the US government evacuated most American passengers from the ship and flew them back to the United States, where they will continue to be quarantined.\u00a0 \n \u201cOur inboxes are constantly full. Keeping up on social media is surprisingly very time-consuming.\u201d She started posting TikTok videos to stave off what she said could be \u201coverwhelming\u201d emotion. \u201cI woke up realising that I\u2019m still here and just started crying.\u201d Engaging on social media, she said, \u201ckeeps me too busy to sit and dwell, I guess.\u201d \n In China, Ms Isabel Dahm, 22, has been able to see her cats and dog back home in Minnesota through chats with her father, Mr Bob Dahm, using an app, WeChat. She is in Zhejiang province, where she\u2019s been teaching English since November and is now largely relegated to her apartment under semi-quarantine. \n \u201cI think if this was happening in the Middle Ages, I would\u2019ve actually gone insane weeks ago,\u201d Ms Dahm said by email. \n She is allowed out of her apartment only every other day, so she is teaching her class online from her computer in her small efficiency apartment. \u201cI have a VPN, a virtual private network, so I\u2019m able to access all of the things I could back in the States, like Netflix, Hulu and YouTube that are normally blocked in China,\u201d she said. She also orders food delivery, but the delivery people are not allowed upstairs. \n \u201cShe\u2019s learned the phrase in Chinese for \u2018I\u2019ll meet you at the gate,\u2019\u201d her father said. \n More substantively, those under quarantine have had unprecedented access to information about the virus itself. For example, in Shenzhen, in the Guangdong province, which has the highest infection rate outside of Wuhan, Ms Krista Lang Blackwood, a teacher from Kansas City, Missouri, follows virus updates from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sometimes, she and her family look out their fifth-floor window and wonder if the quiet streets are telling them infection is spreading. Then they check the phone to find out. \n In earlier times, Ms Lang Blackwood noted in an email, people probably would have fretted over how close the nearest case of illness was. \u201cIn the 21st century, don\u2019t worry! There\u2019s an app for that!\u201d she wrote. \n \u201cYou can literally look at your neighborhood and see where each reported case is on a map. We have no idea who runs that app, since it\u2019s all in Chinese, but, on the app, there is no red exclamation point at the apartment complex down the street. \n \u201cIt\u2019s an odd combination,\u201d she added, \u201cof glut of information combined with isolation\u201d. \n This wid\nespread connectivity appears to be changing the nature of isolation according to experts in two disparate fields \u2014 those who study the sociology of technology use and those who study quarantine. In 1918, during the flu pandemic, parts of the United States embraced a strategy called \u201csocial distancing\u201d, that was explicitly intended to limit interpersonal exposure. Only one-third of households had phones, and people were afraid to touch newspapers, fearing the spread of germs. \n Research, going back decades, shows specific instances in which new media helped limit isolation. Journal articles from the early days of radio show how radio transmissions lifted the spirits of people in isolation at hospitals. An experiment in the late 1950s in Omaha, Nebraska, found that a closed-circuit television signal helped the mood of patients at a mental hospital when they could see and respond to their relatives. \n In 1832, when a cholera outbreak struck North America, newspapers carried news of the infection as it spread. \n \u201cThere is a long history of new media in transforming these moments over time,\u201d said Dr Jeremy Green, director of the history of medicine department at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The current media seems to combine all that which has come before \u2014 letter writing, video, radio and television, and all instantly and everywhere. Referring to the swine flu pandemic of 2009, he said, \u201cEven with H1N1, we didn\u2019t see this particular outcropping of social networking.\u201d \n Dr Jeremy Nobel, an adjunct instructor at the department of global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School, warned that the widespread ability to communicate comes with the equally powerful ability to manipulate, distort and censor information. As a result, he said, people under quarantine may be left to ponder if governments are telling the truth, creating tension between the comfort of interpersonal communications and discomfort of official ones. \u201cIn an era of fake news,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople might ask: What is fact, and what is truth?\u201d \n #day5 #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #quarantine on #diamondprincess a lot of seniors make calls back home. Most seniors have adult children at home and kids worried. #hanginthereprincess #decktime #callinghome pic.twitter.com/zTzFPw299T \n A Chinese doctor who blew the whistle in late December on the spread of the virus wrote to a chat group in his initial message, \u201cquarantined in the emergency room.\u201d The doctor, Lin Wenliang, later died from the infection. \n Ms Shirley Lin, an advertising entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, was communicating regularly through a WeChat group with friends and colleagues in China who have family and friends in Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. Ms Lin said that when someone posted a video that included criticism of the Chinese government, it often disappeared before it could be seen by everyone in the group. \n The surveillance became so worrisome that the group recently abandoned WeChat, which is owned by a Chinese company, in favor of an encrypted mobile phone service, like Telegram or WhatsApp. She said she preferred not to name the precise one to keep it below the government radar. \n A small but growing body of scholarship backs up the idea that social interactions can stimulate reward centers of the brain and, in turn, dampen a stress response, and enhance resilience and even physical health. Mr David Creswell, an associate professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University who works on that research, said that it stood to reason that smartphones, to the extent they are used to make welcome social connection, could diminish the stress of isolation. \n Mr James Katz, a professor of emerging media at Boston University, said: \u201cWithout contact, it\u2019s solitary confinement, which is seen as a cruel and unusual punishment. Being socially cut off is a form of death, but a reversible form of death.

The spread of a new coronavirus in mainland China and to 27 countries and regions beyond is alarming health experts. Here is what we know - and do not know - about the virus:  \n  \n HOW DANGEROUS IS THE VIRUS?  \n The coronavirus family of viruses includes the common cold and more serious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).  \n Many of those with the new virus who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems.  \n Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough and breathing difficulties.  \n Statistics from China indicate that about 2% of peopleinfected with the new virus have died, suggesting it may be deadlier than seasonal flu but less deadly than SARS, which killed about 10% of infected individuals. The MERS outbreak in 2012 had a fatality rate of about 35%.  \n Scientists have labelled the new virus 2019-nCoV.  \n  \n HOW IS IT TRANSMITTED AND HOW CAN IT BE PREVENTED?  \n The virus can be transmitted via droplets when an infectedperson breathes out, coughs or sneezes, and can also spread viacontaminated surfaces such as door handles.  \n Experts have said it is more easily transmitted thanthe SARS virus. The incubation period is up to 14 days. People may be able to infect others before symptoms appear.  \n The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people frequently wash hands, cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.  \n  \n DO FACE MASKS HELP?  \n \"We recommend the use of masks for people who have symptoms ... because the virus transmits through droplets,\" says medical expert Sylvie Briand.  \n But they do not guarantee protection against infection.  \n \"For people who don't have symptoms, the mask in fact is not useful,\" Briand says.  \n The American Centers for Disease Control's advice is that face masks are not required for the general public.  \n  \n IS THERE ANY TREATMENT?  \n There is no vaccine.  \n Chinese scientists were able to identify the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus and shared it publicly.Scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version ofthe virus, a step toward creating a vaccine.  \n Drugmakers around the globe expect to begin testing experimental vaccines on humans in about three months.  \n  \n WHERE HAS IT SPREAD?  \n About 99% of the more than 20,000 cases have been reported in mainland China. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in about 27 other countries and regions, a Reuters tally based on official statements shows.  \n At least 490 people have died in China, most in and around the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines, both following visits to Wuhan.  \n Singapore confirmed four more coronavirus cases on Feb. 5 taking its tally to 28. Thailand has 25 cases.  \n It took the new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first1,000 people. It took SARS 130 days to infect 1,000 people. Ittook MERS 2.5 years to infect 1,000 people.  \n  \n WHAT ARE AUTHORITIES DOING?  \n The Chinese government has virtually locked down the centralprovince of Hubei, home to 60 million people, and its capital Wuhan.  \n China is facing mounting isolation as airlines suspendflights to its cities.  \n The United States and Australia have banned entry to foreignnationals who have recently traveled to China.  \n Many countries have evacuated their citizens from Hubei andare putting them in quarantine or isolation upon return.  \n The WHO has not recommended travel or trade curbs with China.  \n  \n WHERE DID THE VIRUS COME FROM?  \n It is believed to have originated in a food market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.

According to data made public, he was admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital on January 7th to undergo tumour removal surgery, not knowing he had contracted the new coronavirus.\nFour days later the fever suddenly broke. The examinations performed detected an infection in both lungs, so your case was referred to the department of contagious diseases, so that the disease could be correctly diagnosed.

The coronavirus outbreak that started in China's Wuhan city in early December last year has now spread to at least 105 countries/territories. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), as on March 9, there were 109,577 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (the disease caused by this new variant of coronavirus) were reported world over. The global death toll due to COVID-19 stands at 3,809 with most of them (3,123) being reported in China. Despite concerted efforts of the international community, the total number of cases and deaths continues to rise every day.\nWhile China is the epicentre for coronavirus outbreak, the past few weeks have seen a spike in the number of cases and deaths in other countries. South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran are among the worst-hit countries apart from China.\nIn India, 39 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported so far. These have been reported from Kerala, Telangana, Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, Ladakh and Uttar Pradesh. Besides them, thousands of people who are suspected to have come in contact with the confirmed cases have been put in quarantines for observation.\n1) Mapping coronavirus outbreak\nSeveral countries have imposed travel and trade restrictions to and from China as the viral infection continues to spread. Every day hundreds of new cases are being reported from China and elsewhere, triggering a global health scare.\nTo help explain the nature and scale of the coronavirus outbreak, IndiaToday.in is regularly analysing key data and trends related to this epidemic and brings you this in-depth data-driven analysis on coronavirus outbreak.\n(These charts and figures will be regularly updated to provide you the latest information.)\n(The interactive dashbaord presented above has been prepared by the World Health Organisation and monitors coronavirus (COVID-19) cases on a daily basis. You can explore the dashboard using the tabs on the bottom i.e. map, cases by date of report, and cumulative cases)\n2) Overall numbers: COVID-19 cases and deaths\nThe two graphs below show the rate at which COVID-19 cases have risen world over and the number of lives that the coronavirus outbreak has claimed.\n3) Wuhan: Where it all started\nInvestigations into the coronavirus outbreak so far have revealed that the infection started from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province.\nChina officially informed the World Health Organisation about these strange pneumonia-like symptoms emanating from \"unknown causes\" on December 31. Since then, the WHO has been regularly monitoring the situation and issuing guidelines and precautions.\nThe Hubei Province has been the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, accounting for 83 per cent of all cases and 96 per cent of all coronavirus-related deaths in China so far.\nThe map below shows the extent of coronavirus outbreak in China.\nIt is clear that while Hubei Province remains the epicenter of coronavirus outbreak and that COVID-19 cases have been reported from all provinces in China, but all parts of the country are not evenly affected.\nBesides Hubei Province, the other regions that have reported high number of cases are: Gangdong, Henan, Zhejiang and Hunan provinces. The remaining provinces had reported less than 1,000 cases as on March 8. The Xizang province (commonly known as Tibet) is the least affected with just one case reported so far.\nExperts have opinined that yearly migration in China on account of the Lunar New Year festivities could have contributed significantly to the spread of the viral infection across China. The country's Transport Ministry had estimated that nearly 3 billion trips will be made during the festivities, which trigger the world's biggest annual human migration every year.\n4) Coronavirus cases outside China\nThe viral COVID-19 infection that started at a seafood market in Wuhan, has now infected people in at least 101 countries/territories. In the early phase of the outbreak, it was believed that the viral infection cannot transmit between humans.\nHowever, as cases mounted in China and many cases started being reported in other countries, health experts found evidence of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus.\nThe first batch of confirmed coronavirus cases outside China was reported in mid-Janaury: two cases in Thailand and one each in Japan and South Korea.\nFollowing this, several countries started screening passengers arriving\nfrom China at their airports.\nTo explain the geographical spread of coronavirus outbreak, here is a GIF that captures how COVID-19 infection started in China and spread to other parts of the world within few weeks.\nGeographical spread of coronavirus\nThe chart below organises size of countries based on the number of confirmed cases reported in each of them.\n5) Daily trends: New cases & deaths\nThe trend of daily increase/decrese in new cases and deaths is an important indicator that is useful in understanding an outbreak. It helps in figuring out the scale at which new cases/deaths are being reported globally.\nThe following chart shows that number of daily new cases kept on increasing till February 5 (the day when 3,925 new cases were reported) and saw a slow decrease thereafter, indicating that fewer new cases were being reported.\nHowever, on February 13, China changed its methodology of reporting confirmed COVID-19 cases by introducing clinical diagnosis as a method to confirm cases, in addition to laboratory tests. The clinical diagnosis was limited to Hubei Province (where the epicentre of this outbreak--Wuhan--is located), but this methology saw an overnight exponential rise in the daily number of new cases.\nWHO data show that on February 13, China reported 15,158 new coronavirus cases (the highest in a single day). Though the number fell in the following days but since February 21, there has been a rising trend in the number of new cases being reported daily. Our analysis shows that most of these new cases were reported outside China. (We will discuss this aspect in details in the subsequent sections of this article).\n6) People are being cured too\nThe above two daily charts show new COVID-19 cases are being reported from China and other countries every day. But there is another daily trend that seems to indicate a positive development.\nData analysed from the daily status reports of China's National Health Commission show that the number of people who are being released from various hospitals in the country after getting cured in on the rise. Between February 2 and 18, a total of 14,314 coronavirus patients were discharged from hospitals in China. Health authorities will however continue to monitor them for some days.\n7) Appeals for funds\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has appealed to the international community to come forward and contribute funds to combat the coronavirus outbreak. The WHO has set the target of raising $61.5 million to fight this epidemic.\nAs on February 17, the WHO had received only $1 million in form of donations for this cause. However, various countries and international organisations have pledged to contribute and pledged amount so far is $24.4 million. Put together, the amount received and pledged comprise 41.3 per cent of WHO's target.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2070}, {"content": "Animals live for man: China's appetite for wildlife likely to survive coronavirus. For the past two weeks China's police have been raiding houses, restaurants and makeshift markets across the country, arresting nearly 700 people for breaking the temporary ban on catching, selling or eating wild animals.\nThe scale of the crackdown, which has netted almost 40,000 animals including squirrels, weasels and boars, suggests that China's taste for eating wildlife and using animal parts for medicinal purposes is not likely to disappear overnight, despite potential links to the new coronavirus.\nTraders legally selling donkey, dog, deer, crocodile and other meat told Reuters that they plan to get back to business as soon as the markets reopen.\n\"I'd like to sell once the ban is lifted,\" said Gong Jian, who runs a wildlife store online and operates shops in China's autonomous Inner Mongolia region. \"People like buying wildlife. They buy for themselves to eat or give as presents because it is very presentable and gives you face.\"\nGong said that he was storing crocodile and deer meat in large freezers but would have to kill all the quails he had been breeding as supermarkets were no longer buying his eggs and they cannot be eaten after freezing.\nScientists suspect, but have not proven, that the new coronavirus passed to humans from bats via pangolins, a small ant-eating mammal whose scales are highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine.\nSome of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to Wuhan's seafood market, where bats, snakes, civets and other wildlife were sold. China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety.\nThat may not be enough to change tastes or attitudes that are deeply rooted in the country's culture and history.\n\"In many people's eyes, animals are living for man, not sharing the earth with man,\" said Wang Song, a retired researcher of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nONLINE DEBATE\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,600 people in China, revived a debate in the country about the use of wildlife for food and medicine. It previously came to prominence in 2003 during the spread of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which scientists believe was passed to humans from bats, via civets.\nMany academics, environmentalists and residents in China have joined international conservation groups in calling for a permanent ban on trade in wildlife and closure of the markets where wild animals are sold.\nOnline debate within China, likely swayed by younger people, has heavily favored a permanent ban.\n\"One bad habit is that we dare to eat anything,\" said one commenter called Sun on a news discussion forum on Chinese website Sina. \"We must stop eating wildlife and those who do should be sentenced to jail.\"\nNevertheless, a minority of Chinese still like to eat wild animals in the belief it is healthy, providing the demand that sustains wildlife markets like that in Wuhan and a thriving online sales business, much of which is illegal.\nOne online commenter calling themselves Onlooker Pharaoh said on Chinese news platform Hupu that the risk was worth it: \"Giving up wildlife to eat as food is like giving up eating because you might choke.\"\nGOVERNMENT SUPPORT\nThe breeding and trading of wild animals in China is supported by the government and is a source of profit for many people.\nAfter the SARS outbreak, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) strengthened oversight of the wildlife business, licensing the legal farming and sale of 54 wild animals including civets, turtles and crocodiles, and approved breeding of endangered species including bears, tigers and pangolins for environmental or conservation purposes.\nThese officially sanctioned wildlife farming operations produce about $20 billion in annual revenue, according to a 2016 government-backed report.\n\"The state forestry bureau has long been the main force supporting wildlife use,\" said Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist for the Humane Society International. \"It insists on China's right to use wildlife resources for development purposes.\"\nMuch of the farming and sale of wildlife takes place in rural or poorer regions under the blessing of local authorities who see trading as a boost for the local economy. State-backed television programs regularly show people farming animals, including rats, for commercial sale and\ntheir own consumption.\nHowever, activists pushing for a ban describe the licensed farms as a cover for illegal wildlife trafficking, where animals are specifically bred to be consumed as food or medicine rather than released into the wild.\n\"They just use this premise to do illegal trading,\" Zhou Jinfeng, head of China's Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, told Reuters. \"There are no real pangolin farms in China, they just use the permits to do illegal things.\"\nThe NFGA did not respond to requests for comment.\nBLURRED LINES\nAnimal products, from bear bile to pangolin scales, are still used in some traditional Chinese medicine, an industry China wants to expand as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.\nBut the distinction between legal and illegal is blurred. The United Nations estimates the global illegal wildlife trade is worth about $23 billion a year. China is by far the largest market, environmental groups say.\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an independent organization based in London which campaigns against what it sees as environmental abuses, said in a report this week the coronavirus outbreak has in fact boosted some illegal wildlife trafficking as traders in China and Laos are selling rhinoceros horn medicines as a treatment to reduce fever.\nChina's top legislature will toughen laws on wildlife trafficking this year, the official Xinhua news agency reported this week.\n\"We are in a sun-setting business,\" said Xiang Chengchuan, a wholesale wildlife store owner in the landlocked eastern Anhui province. \"Few people eat dogs now, but it was popular 20 years ago.\"\nXiang, who sells gift boxes of deer antlers and dog, donkey and peacock meat to wealthy bank clients and others, said he had frozen his meat as he waits to see if the ban will continue.\n\"I will resume selling once the policy allows us, but now I have no idea how long it [the ban] will last.\"\n", "label": 1, "id": 2071}, {"content": "Surging traffic is slowing down the Internet as coronavirus keeps people at home. WASHINGTON (NYTIMES) - In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average Internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more often and clogged the networks. In Hubei province, the epicentre of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. \n In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, Internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. \n And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, e-mails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 per cent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 per cent in San Jose, California, and 24 per cent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. \n Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the Internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and video gaming has surged to new highs, the stress on Internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the US - and the traffic is probably far from its peak. \n \"This is totally unprecedented,\" said Mr Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Telecom. \"We have to be proactive.\" \n To head off problems, European regulators like Mr Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they do not take up as much bandwidth. In the US, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. \n Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease Internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft's Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. \n \"We really don't know how long we're going to be in this mode for,\" Mr Dave Temkin, Netflix's vice-president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday (March 25) on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. \n Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefonica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. \n Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Mr Enrique Blanco, chief technology officer at Telefonica, a Spanish telecommunications company. \n \"In just two days, we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,\" Mr Blanco said. \n On Monday, traffic on AT&T's networks was up 27 per cent compared with\u00a0the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 per cent increase in traffic on its wireless and fibre broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. \n In Europe, Internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 per cent, according to Telefonica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. \n So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading webpages and apps, according to Ookla. \n \"Congestion is higher,\" said Ms Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokesman. \"We're all at home and the activities we're doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.\" \n Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 per cent in the US. \n The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Mr Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice-president in charge of WebEx. \n \"I don't know if we'll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,\" he said. \"The reason I say that is because we aren't seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.\" \n Internet service providers said they could handle\nthe deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fibre connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. \n Orange, formerly France Telecom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea Internet cables. In Italy, where home Internet use is up 90 per cent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe's largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 per cent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. \n \"We're seeing some signs of stress,\" AT&T\u00a0chief executive\u00a0Randall Stephenson\u00a0said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. \"We're having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we're sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.\" \n To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. \n Last week, Mr Breton, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Mr Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Mr Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Ms Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. \n Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 per cent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. \n \"We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimise stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,\" YouTube said in a statement. \n Microsoft's Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical Internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. \n Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. \n \"Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we're optimising service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,\" the company said. \"At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we're also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.\" \n While US regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. \n \"The FCC has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,\" Mr Ajit Pai, the agency's chairman, said in a statement. \n Telefonica's Mr Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. \n In Spain, Internet use drops only at 8pm, when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. \n \"Suddenly at 8pm it goes down;\u00a0then it goes back up,\" Mr Blanco said. \"It's a beautiful thing.\"\n", "label": 1, "id": 2072}, {"content": "India shifts diplomats in Herat, Jalalabad to Kabul as Covid-19 cases rise in Afghanistan.

The forum was attended by\u00a0more than 300 scientists and researchers, including some who took part virtually from China and Taiwan. \n \"The Chinese colleagues are very eager to participate in protocols which are being defined so that all the clinical trials are done according to the same standards and are looking towards the same outcome,\"\u00a0she said. \"They were very interested in working on such a master protocol.\"\u00a0 \n The coronavirus, now dubbed Covid-19, that emerged in central China in December has infected more than 44,000 people and killed over 1,100 in China and has spread to at least 24 other countries. \n Dr Kieny said quite a number of patients have already been dosed with a combination of the antiviral drugs ritonavir and lopinavir, but she did not have an exact count. \n \"(It) would be excellent if it would work because this drug is available in particular as a generic formulation for the treatment of HIV, so this would clearly be a drug that would be available,\"\u00a0Dr Kieny said. \n The combination HIV therapy is sold under the brand name Kaletra by AbbVie Inc. \n It remains to be seen whether the treatment will prove effective against the new virus, she said. \n \"We don\u2019t know the result, and we still have to wait for a few days, or a few weeks to have a result.\"\u00a0 \n A state-run Chinese research institute applied last week for a patent on the use of the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir from US-based Gilead Sciences Inc, which scientists hope may be effective against the coronavirus. \n \"They will very soon start to dose patients on remdesivir... which had been tested without much success with Ebola, but Ebola virus and coronavirus are different and it may have a better success with corona,\"\u00a0Dr Kieny said.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2079}, {"content": "WHO decides this Thursday whether new virus is a global public health emergency. The World Health Organisation (WHO) postponed its decision to Thursday on whether or not the new pneumonia virus is a global public health emergency. On Wednesday, the WHO emergency committee met in Geneva, Switzerland, but Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO, announced earlier this evening that further deliberation on on the existing data was still needed. If a global public health emergency is declared, this will be the fifth time this has happened in recent years. More than 540 cases of this viral pneumonia originating in China, a new coronavirus (designated 2019-nCoV) and 17 deaths, have already been confirmed.\nAt the press conference early this Wednesday evening, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus began by saying that this is an \"emerging and complex\" situation and praised the detailed presentation of data by China. Despite stating that there was \"an excellent discussion\" during this Wednesday's meeting, he said that more information is needed. \"I have decided to ask the emergency committee to meet again tomorrow afternoon [this Thursday] to continue the discussion,\" he said.\nTo justify this, the WHO Director pointed out: \"The decision on whether or not a global public health emergency is declared is something that I take extremely seriously and that I am only prepared to do with proper consideration of all evidence.\"\nMike Ryan (director of the WHO emergency programme) stressed that public health actions need not begin with the global public health emergency declaration. \"These actions are already well under way.\" He also warned that the priority is to find the source of how the virus is being transmitted among people. \"The main issue is to limit the transmission from human to human.\"\nMaria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the WHO Emergency Diseases Unit, also reported that there is evidence that transmission from person to person takes place during close contact, such a s between family members or in health care environments. \"This is not unexpected in a respiratory disease. But we have no evidence that a subsequent transmission will occur as a third or fourth generation transmission.\" He indicated, adding that a secondary level of transmission was also not observed in countries to which the virus was exported. That is, from an infected person traveling from China to another country and there has been a new infection.\nAccording to the WHO, a global public health emergency is defined as \"an exceptional situation that is determined because it constitutes a public health risk to other States due to international transmission of the disease and because it potentially needs a coordinated response at international level.\" All this means that, in this case, the situation is considered serious, sudden, unexpected and requires immediate action at global level.\nThe official investigation of this viral pneumonia began on the 31 of December 2019 when the WHO representation in China was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause. These cases had been detected in the city of Wuhan in the Chinese province of Hubei.\nThe very next day a fish and live animals market was closed in Wuhan, where the outbreak began to be detected, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. Preliminary investigations revealed that some cases were diagnosed in workers or visitors who visited the market, \"where wild animals are being sold illegally\", says Reuters. OMS even reports that the source of this outbreak is likely to be animal. The marketing of live birds and wild animals in the city has been prohibited.\n9 in January the first outbreak-related death was reported: a man of 61 with other associated health problems. And 10th in January the authorities announced that the virus was a new coronavirus, a group of viruses that causes respiratory infections in humans and animals and is transmitted by air (by coughing or sneezing) or by physical contact. If some coronavirus only results in a cold, others may cause more severe respiratory diseases such a s severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\nAndrew Rambaut, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh (Scotland), quoted in a newspaper in Science, published on his Twitter that this new coronavirus bears a resemblance to\nSARS in about 89%. The latest SARS outbreak also began in China and more than 8000 and 800 deaths occurred between 2002 and 2003 around the world.\nThe Chinese health authorities have also confirmed that the new coronavirus is transmissible between humans. Symptoms of this pneumonia include fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Quoted by the BBC, Li Bin, Deputy Minister of the National Health Commission of China, said at a press conference that there is evidence that the disease was \"mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract\", but has not yet been able to ascertain its exact origin. The British newspaper The Guardian also highlights that it is the poorest people who are most at risk of being infected.\nIn China, there are already cases in major population centres such as Shanghai, Macao, Hong Kong and Beijing. 13th of January, the first case was announced outside the country: it was detected in Thailand. However, infected people have been identified in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. The passage of the virus to the United States was identified in a man of 30-year-old Washington state after returning from a trip to Wuhan, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThere have been more than 540 cases of infected people (including healthcare workers) and 17 deaths have been reported. Based on the trips to Wuhan, a group of scientists from Imperial College in London have estimated that there are already 4000 cases of people infected with the new coronavirus in Wuhan.\nThere is also some fear that this viral pneumonia may spread further during the Chinese Lunar New Year festivities, which begins next Friday (24 in January). This is a time when millions of Chinese travel because of celebrations. The country's authorities have already appealed to people not to travel to and from Wuhan. \"Basically, do not go to Wuhan. Since those in Wuhan do not leave the city, please,\" Li Bin asked. The Chinese authorities have also assumed that the country is now \"in its most critical state\" of prevention and control of the virus.\nThe last time the WHO declared a global public health emergency was in 2019 for the Ebola virus outbreak, which is still ongoing in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has already killed more than 2000 people. The WHO also considered the following epidemics as international public health emergencies: in 2016, the Zika virus; in 2014, the previous Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11.000 people between 2014 and 2016; in 2014, polio; in 2009, swine flu (the H1N1 virus).\n", "label": 1, "id": 2080}, {"content": "Rupee gains 7 paise against dollar on rebound in equities.

It's a matter of compliance,\" Mr Yuen said. \n \"We cannot guard against the virus forever, but the longer we delay its spread, the higher the chances of getting a vaccine in time.\" \n In a separate interview also published on Sunday by mainland Chinese online media Caixin, Mr Yuen said his team and other scientists were developing a vaccine.

SINGAPORE \u2014 Although it is still far too early to say the worst is over, the Covid-19 outbreak appears to have tapered off in Singapore in the past week, several experts said on Friday (Feb 21), four weeks after the coronavirus was first confirmed here. \n However, there is a growing concern that further cases of the infection could arrive from countries outside China and disrupt this recent positive streak, four infectious health diseases experts said in giving their take on the broad Covid-19 picture to date. \n Since the peak of confirmed cases a week ago, when nine cases were confirmed here in one day, Feb 14, experts noted that the number of new cases detected has fallen steadily, although there is no way to be certain that another surge will not happen. \n On both Thursday and Friday only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 in Singapore was reported by the Ministry of Health (MOH). \n On Wednesday, three cases were reported, including a 57-year-old woman who had initially been admitted to hospital for dengue fever. It was later confirmed she had both Covid-19 and dengue. \n No new clusters of local transmission have been detected for several days and most of the latest cases can all be traced back to earlier ones. A large number of patients confirmed with the disease have\u00a0been discharged from the hospitals where they had been isolated. \n \u201cThe hysteria will quieten down in the next month unless something unexpected happens,\"\u00a0Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) research policy and co-operation department in Geneva told TODAY. \n \"But, as I have said, the virus will most likely remain in the population. In my view? Normalise everything and learn to live with the virus,\u201d he added. \n Recent reports from China, where the disease Covid-19 originated, have suggested that new transmission of the virus that causes it, Sars-CoV-2, has also fallen dramatically over the last few days. \n Referring to this trend, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had said that Chinese data \u201cappears to show a decline in new cases\u2019\u2019 but noted that any apparent trend \u201cmust be interpreted very cautiously\u201d. \n Using data made available by the Singapore MOH, TODAY looked at how the pace of the Covid-19 outbreak has changed over the past four weeks since Case 1, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20 and was confirmed with the disease on Jan 23. \n DOWNWARD TREND IN THE NUMBER OF CASES IN PAST WEEK \n  \n Looking at the daily number of confirmed cases, the Covid-19 situation appears to have slowed in the past week, with a sharp drop in the number of cases from the record of nine on Feb 14 to one confirmed case on Friday. \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said it looks like the number of cases found on Feb 13 and 14, mostly arising from the Grace Assembly of God cluster, appears to be the peak of the outbreak in Singapore. \n \"The number of cases is coming down,\u201d said Dr Leong. \n He noted that Singapore has been doing hundreds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests per day \u2014 the test used to detect Covid-19 \u2014 and these cases must be seen in that context. \n \u201cThis means that we are truly looking for a needle in the haystack, which means the number of cases is truly low. There are very few, if not no cases of active transmission in Singapore,\u201d he said. \n Agreeing with Dr Leong, Dr Pangestu said that the supposed peak outbreak here on Feb 14 is consistent with earlier scientific models that predicted that the number of new infections of the Covid-19 virus would peak in mid to late February. Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan, the eminent 83-year-old epidemiologist who had discovered the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, had given the same prediction as well. \n One study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted a February peak based on the basic reproductive number of Covid-19, which is the expected number of cases directly generated by one patient. For Covid-19, this number averages between 1.5 and 4.5. \n Biostatistician Alex Cook, who is the vice dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said it is \u201ccertainly a good thing that the number of cases has been going down\u201d. \n \u201c(This fa\nlling trend) reflects the cases to identify and be isolated, and the efforts of MOH to conduct contact tracing, and healthcare workers to minimise infection in hospitals,\u201d said Associate Professor Cook, who is the domain leader for biostatistics and modelling at the school. \n His colleague, Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, the school\u2019s programme leader of infectious diseases and the co-director of global health, added that the fall in the number of confirmed cases in the past week indicates that Singapore\u2019s efforts have been successful in limiting the spread of Covid-19. \n \u201cIt is likely that current massive contact tracing \u2014 initiated right at the start of the outbreak in Singapore \u2014 has led to the majority of cases being uncovered. Current quarantine and social distancing measures have also worked to reduce transmission in Singapore,\u201d said Assoc Prof Hsu. \n FEWER NEW PRIMARY CASES DETECTED IN RECENT WEEKS \n  \n A key indicator is the number of primary cases found on a given day \u2014 patients who have had no known link to previous cases and could have contracted the virus through local transmission. \n Singapore upgraded its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level to Orange on Feb 7 when it discovered another three such primary cases, including Case 32, a Victoria Junior College teacher who had no recent travel history to China and no known link to the earlier cases. \n While finding these primary cases helps the authorities discover new ones through contact-tracing, they also highlight that there are more unknowns about how the Covid-19 situation is spreading in the community, said experts. \n But in the past week, no new cluster and fewer primary cases have appeared. The exceptions are the recently discovered Case 82, a 57-year-old Singaporean who had contracted both dengue and Covid-19, and Case 85, a 35-year-old Chinese national who did not travel to China recently. \n As these cases were confirmed only recently, a link could be established later when more detailed contact tracing has taken place. \n Commenting on this trend of fewer primary cases in the past week, Prof Pangestu said he hoped this would help to calm the public. \n While it could also mean that potential primary cases are still hidden from view, it is unlikely as the Singapore Government has been \u201cvery vigilant\u201d in contact tracing. The trend shows that infected people have been effectively detected, isolated and treated. \n \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of these epidemics \u2014 they start explosively and then run out of steam as public health measures kick in and the virus runs out of susceptible hosts.\u201d \n Dr Leong noted that with Singapore expanding its case definitions to screen all patients with pneumonia for Covid-19, it is unlikely that cases would fall under the radar. \n But Singapore\u2019s strengths in contact tracing will still be limited by the ability for patients to recall where they have been and with whom they have interacted, which could account for those cases with no known links, he said. \n \u201cLousy recollection means lousy contact tracing, which leads to lousy curtailment. We need to think out of the box,\u201d said Dr Leong, suggesting that there should be a mobile phone application that is able to help build Singapore\u2019s capability in contact tracing in future. \n LARGE PORTION OF EARLIER CASES DISCHARGED \n  \n Experts also noted that a majority of the cases detected in the first two weeks of the outbreak have been discharged, a trend that is similar to the experience in other countries. This high rate of discharges is also a sign that the Covid-19 situation is improving in Singapore. \n As of Friday, 47 out of the 86 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. The number of cases in critical condition \u2014 five currently \u2014 has also come down. \n The number of discharged cases does not include Covid-19 patients who do not suffer from any symptoms throughout their infection but are still hospitalised. \n Assoc Prof Hsu noted that in this regard, data published out of China and other countries has\u00a0been similar. \n \u201cCovid-19 infections are mild for more than 80 per cent of patients, which means these patients would not have needed hospitalisation based on medical needs alone. The patients were kept isolated in hospital to minimise the risk that they would spread the virus to others in the community,\u201d he said. \n While there is no known vaccine for the disease yet, in Singapore and elsewhere, Covid-19 patients are t\nreated with a mix of antiviral drugs normally used for HIV cases, such as ritonavir and lopinavir. These have been promising, Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, MOH\u2019s chief health scientist said previously. \n Besides Singapore becoming more adept at treating Covid-19, there is also the chance that the virus could be turning milder which would explain why the newer cases are not so severe, said Dr Leong. \n Of the cases in China, Covid-19 has a mortality rate of around 2.3 per cent. By comparison, Sars had a mortality rate of 9.6 per cent during the 2003 outbreak, while Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) has a fatality rate of 35 per cent. \n The mortality rate of Covid-19 outside China \u2014 based on a small number of deaths \u2014 is lower still, at around 0.2 per cent, which is similar to swine flu and slightly above the seasonal flu. \n Prof Pangestu added: \u201cThe implication of this? It simply proves that most cases of Covid-19 are not severe and people should not be unduly concerned. It\u2019s just like the flu and Zika.\u201d \n MAJORITY OF CASES WITH NO LINK TO CHINA \n  \n However, a concerning statistic has emerged in recent weeks: Cases that cannot be traced back to mainland China have now exceeded those with a known link to China, said experts. \n Dr Leong said while it is no cause for alarm, the fact that a majority of cases have no link to China shows how close Singapore came to losing the ability to contain the viral spread from China. \n He said strong contact tracing helped to rein in the numbers, otherwise the unknown cases would continue to mount. \n \u201cThe first round of infection comes from China. The second round comes from locals who were infected with contact with the Chinese. That is expected in any ongoing epidemic. It is crucial to keep the lid on the second group and we seem to have done it,\u201d said Dr Leong. \n But the experts suggested that something more surreptitious could be at play given the mounting travel restrictions against China. There is a growing concern that undetected cases of Covid-19 may be entering Singapore from other countries. \n Said Dr Leong: \u201cWithin China, the numbers are coming down and it is good that viral spread in the source (country) is being controlled. But the more important question is those who have left China and seeded to countries with less resources \u2014 can they take the heat?\u201d \n Covid-19 cases outside China are growing at an accelerating rate. The number of new cases detected outside China climbed at a steady rate since Feb 7, and crossed the threshold of 100 new daily cases for the first time on Feb 17 and has remained high ever since. \n While the number of imported cases of Covid-19 in Singapore has\u00a0been negligible after Singapore put in place border control measures, Assoc Prof Cook predicts that this could climb again, with increasing numbers of imports from other countries seeding more clusters in Singapore. \n \u201cIn normal times there is a lot of travel to and from Singapore and places like Japan and Thailand, both of which have quite large numbers of confirmed cases,\u201d he said. \n Given Singapore\u2019s close proximity and connections to Malaysia and Indonesia, Assoc Prof Cook said he is also concerned about the risk of future importation from these two nations. Indonesia has zero detected cases of Covid-19, though a Harvard study had questioned whether this was due to its lack of detection rather than the incidence of the virus. \n \u201cWith more cases being observed beyond China it looks far too early to celebrate,\u201d said Assoc Prof Cook. \n \u00a0\n", "label": 1, "id": 2101}, {"content": "Amid cornavirus scare, second wave of flu hits US kids. A second wave of flu is hitting the US, turning this into one of the nastiest seasons for children in a decade.\nThe number of child deaths and the hospitalisation rate for youngsters are the highest seen at this point in any season since the severe flu outbreak of 2009-10, health officials said Friday. And the wave is expected to keep going for weeks.\nExperts say that it is potentially a bad time for an extended flu season, given concerns about the new coronavirus out of China, which can cause symptoms that can be difficult to distinguish from flu without testing.\n\"If coronavirus were to begin spreading in the US, there could be confusion about whether people are getting sick with it or the flu,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.\nThis flu season got off to its earliest start in 15 years, with surges of flu-like illnesses seen in parts of the South as early as October. Most cases were caused by a type of flu that usually causes substantial infections only in the spring, at the tail end of the flu season.\nThat wave peaked in late December and dropped steadily for weeks afterwards.\nBut a second surge began in late January. Last week saw another rise in the percentage of doctor's office visits that were due to flu-like illness, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\"We have not yet peaked for influenza. We are still on our way up,\" Dr. David Weber, a University of North Carolina infectious-diseases specialist, said of the patient traffic in Chapel Hill.\nOverall, the CDC estimated that 26 million Americans have gotten sick with flu this past fall and winter, with about 250,000 flu-related hospitalizations and around 14,000 deaths.\nThe viruses behind both waves can be hard on children and young adults. But they aren't considered as dangerous to retirement-age people -- good news, since most flu deaths and hospitalisations each winter occur in the elderly.\nIn fact, the overall death and hospitalization rates this season are not high \"because we haven't seen the elderly as involved in this flu season,\" said the CDC's Lynnette Brammer.\nBut 92 flu-related deaths have already been reported in children, a higher total at this point of the year than in any season in the past decade. And the hospitalization rates also are far higher than what's been seen at this point.\nThe CDC said that the reason is that two strains of the flu that are tough on children are spreading in the same season.\nThe health agency is expected to release an estimate next week of how effective the flu vaccine has been.\nSo far, only 15 US cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed, and no deaths. All but two of the cases were in people who had traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the international outbreak. The remaining two were spread from travelers to their spouses.\nSchaffner said that for the time being, it is easy to determine a likely coronavirus case by asking about a patient's travel history.\nIt's possible that concern about the coronavirus has led some people with flu symptoms to go to the doctor for testing this year, whereas they might have just stayed home in other years, Brammer said. But there is nothing in CDC data that shows that's been happening, she added.\n\"Still, it's OK if it does happen,\" said the CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier.\n\"People being a little worried and seeking care doesn't especially worry me, because that's the point. We're looking for broader spread within the community,\" she said.\nTo that end, health officials will be using five public health labs that usually test for flu to start checking also for coronavirus. The labs are in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle. When a specimen tests negative for flu, it will then be tested for coronavirus, Messonnier said.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2102}, {"content": "coronavirus deaths in italy overtake china as economic damage mounts.

On the one hand, media such as TIME ONLINE report every day on increasing infections, drastic quarantine measures in China, new suspicious cases. On the other hand, there are a lot of experts who keep repeating: in Germany, even in Europe, nobody needs to worry at the moment. Will one sentence cause panic just to catch them again the next? No, the situation is just very complex and its outcome uncertain. Four reasons why this outbreak deserves our full attention.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nThe Coronavirus is probably not much worse than flu viruses, mom\nAt the moment many eat and want to calm down. But this comparison is not good. First of all, the virus flu is not harmless. Those who are sick themselves once, a week of high fever, tearing limb pain, intense sweating at night, absolute powerlessness, know this. Thousands of people die each year in Germany* from the consequences, in bad years more than 20.000. And yet the vaccination rates are chronically low, because many, even unconscious, believe they know the flu.\nConversely, people tend to evaluate new dangers such as the rather unknown Coronavirus first. This cannot be resolved, especially as it is reported. Of course, it could turn out that the 2019-nCoV is less bad than influenza viruses. But what if the opposite is the case, and like the closely related Sars virus, every tenth person diagnosed dies? What if the media and the authorities had not informed us in depth? Anyone who claims to be panicking should ask themselves: why am I so sure that the virus is harmless? Because they're not experts.\nNobody knows what's coming for us right now. We still know very little: How many people are affected by the infection with 2019-nCoV? How many have no symptoms at all? And are people contagious when they don't have symptoms yet? How contagious are the sick? At least there are preliminary answers to all of this.\nThe next few days will show that most of the infected people in China were infected last week. And these people still have the gravest thing ahead of them. Previous studies show that on average it takes about a week from the first symptoms to severe lung problems (The Lancet: Huang et al., 2020). This means that very soon, thousands of Chinese patients will come to the point where it becomes clear whether the disease is easy or severe for them. The 100-dead will soon be more. Just how many, nobody knows that right now.\nAt the same time, however, it also means that no one who gets on a subway in Germany and takes a bus stop has to worry. There is no killer virus, there is no reason to assume that hospitals will overflow in a few days'time. A handful of cases in Germany do not change the situation. And even if there's more to come, which is likely, there's no reason to panic. For those who have spoken like TIME ONLINE and TIME with experts, from the airport doctor to the professor of virology to the federal authorities such as the Robert Koch Institute, have a clear picture: everyone is prepared, everyone knows what to do, nobody underestimates this virus. And it seems that the first four cases, which were on the 28th, were also followed. January was reported in Bavaria, for the time being smooth. Within a short time they were tested after it was clear that a colleague from China who was visiting was infected. And a few hours after the first test was positive, 40 contacts had already been found and contacted.\n*Note from the editorial staff: Of course, this figure related to Germany. We have subsequently specified this in the text.\nSo it is less the first case in Germany that deserves our attention. What we can see these days, especially in China, is a world-historical event that affects millions of people: travel bans, blocked roads, railway stations and airports, cancelled major events, closed schools and universities, oral protection. It's an outbreak of the superlatives, full of the first time, full of things that have never happened before. All in real time.\nA new virus appears on the world stage in a city where eleven million people live. Rasant is spreading, thousands of infected are known within a few weeks, the real number is likely to be even higher. Just as quickly, however, is the response of the Chinese and scientists worldwide: it only takes days for Chinese researchers to discover and decipher the virus, and just once two weeks for a test to prove it. In just a few days new findings will follow: scientists calculate and continuously update the number of infected, are\nThese studies describe the course of the disease, biologists try to understand, using genetic differences in virus samples, how long the pathogen can infect humans.\nThe outbreak is an impressive illustration of the great advances made in science such as evolutionary biology, virology, molecular biology or biotechnology in recent decades. The response to 2019-nCoV from science and technology is so strong and diverse that it is clear that humanity is not helpless and defenceless against a new pathogen.\nAnd China has long become a technological superpower. You can not only fly to the moon and invest massively in artificial intelligence for years, but you can also build new hospitals with thousands of beds within a few days.\nUntil 2002, when the Sars virus broke out in China, a close relative of the new Coronavirus, it took weeks for the authorities to react adequately until they passed data on to the World Health Organisation and to researchers worldwide. This time, much seems radically different: China shared data from the beginning of the outbreak. Information policy is also different from 2002 because the world is more interconnected.\nAnd China can no longer afford to remain silent. The country invests billions of euros in international infrastructure projects: from the port of Piraeus in Greece to the high-speed trains in Kenya. And along these paths, for example, Pulitzer Prize winner Laurie Garrett worries that pathogens like the Coronavirus could spread faster than ever in the future. Even in places where health systems have little to do with the virus, for example in sub-Saharan Africa.\nIf the Chinese authorities try to contain the Coronavirus regionally or nationally, they are doing something for the whole world. That is also why we should not lose sight of this outbreak.\n", "label": 0, "id": 2112}, {"content": "world\u2019s biggest water fights called off as southeast asia scales back new year.

HONG KONG - Support for the demands of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong has grown even as rallies have paused due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a survey conducted for Reuters that also showed a widespread lack of confidence in the government's ability to manage the COVID-19 crisis.  \n Demands for the resignation of Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, were supported by 63% of respondents in the poll, conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute between March 17-20, versus 57% in a poll it conducted in December.  \n Supporters of the protests outnumbered opponents by a ratio of roughly two to one, with 28% against them compared with 30% in a poll in December, and 58% supporting them, versus 59% previously.  \n The poll showed a significant increase in the levels of support for key demands of the often-violent demonstrations which rattled the city for most of last year and into early January before the coronavirus crisis.  \n The survey also showed a widespread lack of confidence in the government's coronavirus measures, with 54% expressing distrust and 33% giving the thumbs up.  \n The anti-government protests escalated in June 2019 over a since withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions of defendants to mainland China, and later morphed into a movement for greater democracy in the Chinese-ruled city.  \n Many protesters say Beijing has used its authority under the \"one country, two systems\" formula, agreed when Britain handed over the city to China in 1997, to undermine freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong that are unavailable in the mainland.  \n \"It is understandable that protesters resort to extreme means,\" said Patrick Yeung, a 32-year-old IT worker who responded to the survey. \"I hope Beijing can meddle less in Hong Kong's affairs, which could actually stabilise Hong Kong and curb people's anger.\"  \n Beijing denies meddling in Hong Kong and blames the West for fomenting unrest.  \n For more comments from respondents see.  \n Lam's office and China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which comes under the State Council, or cabinet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \n Support for universal suffrage in Hong Kong, a core demand of protesters aimed at strengthening the territory's level of autonomy, rose to 68% from 60% in December.  \n An independent commission of inquiry, which protesters want to look into how the police handled demonstrations, is now supported by 76% of respondents versus 74% previously.  \n The demands of the protesters \"haven't been diluted, or forgotten, due to the epidemic situation,\" said Ma Ngok, associate professor of government and public administration at Chinese University of Hong Kong.  \n Opposition to the demands of the protesters has remained virtually unchanged at 15%.  \n \"The government should investigate the culprits behind the political crisis and should not accede to other demands from the protesters,\" said another respondent, Ming Hon, an unemployed 49-year-old who moved to Hong Kong from mainland China recently and had jobs in cleaning and construction.  \n For the poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, 1,001 respondents were randomly surveyed by telephone in Cantonese, which is spoken by the vast majority of people in Hong Kong. The results were weighted according to the latest population figures.  \n  \n VIRUS RESPONSE  \n Following a large rally on New Year's Day in which some protesters clashed with police, crowds on the streets have dropped from many thousands to a few hundred as Hong Kongers adopted social distancing to fight the coronavirus.  \n Some recent protests focused on the government's decision not to fully close the border with mainland China, where the virus is believed to have originated. The administration has since banned all tourist arrivals.  \n Although Hong Kong has won praise for limiting the outbreak to roughly 450 cases and four deaths, the poll showed that many citizens remain distrustful of the government.  \n \"The results in combating the pandemic are because of the self-discipline of Hong Kong people. The government has nothing to do with it,\" said Evelyn Lau, a 23-year-old tutor who participated in the poll.  \n  \n OPPOSITION TO INDEPENDENCE  \n Another key finding of the survey is that while calls for Hong Kong's independence from China grew within the margin of error, opposition to th\ne idea has dropped significantly and indifference has increased dramatically.  \n Support for independence rose from 17% in December to 20%, but opposition tumbled from 68% to 56%, and those not leaning either way doubled to 18%.  \n \"People talk more about it, so it becomes more easy to accept,\" said Samson Yuen, assistant professor in the political science department at Lingnan University, referring to the independence issue. \"When people talk more about 'liberating Hong Kong', it shifts the frame.\"  \n With Legislative Council elections due in September, the pro-democracy/pro-Beijing split remained virtually unchanged from last year's district council vote, with 58% saying they would vote for a pro-democracy candidate and 22% for a pro-Beijing one, with the rest undecided or not planning to vote.  \n The degree of support for the protests varied sharply by age, education and whether respondents were born in Hong Kong. Younger and better-educated people born in the city were far more likely to lean pro-democracy or support the protests.  \n The poll, the second in a series commissioned by Reuters from the independent polling firm to gauge public sentiment amid the city's worst political crisis in decades, showed respondents mainly blamed Lam's administration for the state of affairs.  \n Some 43% of respondents primarily blamed the Hong Kong government, compared with 47% in the previous poll, while 14% blamed the central government in Beijing versus 12% in December. The police and protesters were blamed by about 10% each in both polls.  \n Many protesters say they are incensed by what they see as an abuse of power by the police in dealing with the unrest. The police say they have used reasonable and appropriate force against illegal acts including vandalism and rioting.  \n China has denounced acts of violence in the protests, which it sees as being aimed at undermining Chinese sovereignty.

Franka Lu is a Chinese journalist and entrepreneur. She works in China and Germany. In this TIME ONLINE series she critically reports on life, culture and everyday life in China. To protect her professional and private environment, she writes under a pseudonym.\nAt the apparent peak of his power, the most powerful authoritarian regime in the world is shaken by a virus. This country, the People's Republic of China under Xi Jinping, is about to become a world leader in the development of quantum computers and artificial intelligence, it has excellent telecommunications technology, the fastest trains in the world, highly trained officials and a prestigious viral research. But all this is of little concern to the new Coronavirus.\nIts spread now exposes the weaknesses of the system mercilessly. China's bureaucratic health system was clearly not prepared for such a case. Overcrowded hospitals rejected patients, initially poorly protected doctors and carers even contracted the Coronavirus. And the question is long overdue, with the Chinese central government actually being more efficient in recent weeks: in controlling the outbreak of disease, or rather in controlling the population and the flow of information?\nIn times of social media, especially in China, where WeChat and Weibo are the big platforms instead of Facebook and Twitter, it is now clear that information shared by users on social media can only be controlled by means of censorship and thus deletion only conditionally. These users come especially from the younger generation, in the 1980s or after, whose members have never experienced such chaos. These youngsters have grown up in the most economically happy decades of Chinese history and have benefited from the growing prosperity that their parents, in particular, have achieved and that is largely due to the globalisation from which China has benefited so unprecedented as a place of production. These young Chinese people have so far largely trusted the communist authorities. Their lack of response to the threat posed by the new Coronavirus now shakes this belief.\nIn the crisis, young people mobilise an unprecedented energy to help themselves, and they also often organise it through social media. They get respiratory masks and bring them to hospitals; they provide medical personnel with cars; They help elderly and sick people trapped at home and try to support refugees from Hubei. Civilian society is making great efforts to fill the gap that leaves a lack of action on the part of the authorities and their obvious over-reliance on the outbreak of the virus.\nAt the same time, the existence of social media platforms allows something quite different: it is precisely thanks to them that an attempt can be made to reconstruct the events since the emergence of the new Coronavirus in China, as they have largely not been reported in the state media; also a report by Human Rights Watch, the 30-year-old. In January, it supports these searches. These show how inadequate or even covert the authorities have acted at local and central level until at least mid-January.\nThe story of the spread of this virus began almost a month and a half ago, like many disasters in China, as a rumor. When patients with identical symptoms arrived in a hospital at the end of December in the 14-million-city of Wuhan, doctors reported the cases to the local centre for disease care, a half-body. According to social media posts, their officials appeared on 27. In December \"very impatient\" in the hospital there and listened to the concerns of the doctors with great reluctance.\nThree days later, 30th. In December 2019, this precautionary authority communicated internally that all hospitals should be prepared for an \"unknown lung disease\", with doctors being \"strictly forbidden\" to give information to the public. Nor did the Authority itself inform the public. Doctors who did not work directly in the departments for fever and lung diseases were\nthe possible seriousness of the situation in the dark, they were therefore unprotected in dealing with possible Corona patients. Many of them later experienced how serious the situation really was.\nIn the afternoon and evening of this day, several doctors from different hospitals posted in their chat groups and WeChat diagnoses of their patients and expressed their concern about the inactivity of the precautionary authority. They warned colleagues of the dangers posed by the local fish and game market, which was soon suspected of being an outbreak. Doctors also explained that the symptoms of the expanding lung disease were reminiscent of Sars, the highly contagious, life-threatening infectious disease that had spread from South China at the end of 2002, early 2003. This information and internal government communication reached the public, screenshots from the chats spread virally. On Weibo, users started using the hashtag WuhanSARS. Their posts were quickly deleted from censorship.\nThe morning of 31st. In December, one of the doctors who published the information on the new Coronavirus was appointed by the City Health Commission of Wuhan, the city's top health authority, WMHC. He had to reveal his sources. The next day, the party secretary's office asked the doctor for an apology for the \"spread of rumors\" and also for an assurance that from now on nothing would leak out. Then he had to take a warning from the police and sign it.\nOn the same day, for the first time, official media representatives came to the WMHC to obtain confirmation of the \"rumours\" that had been circulating for several days. Under increasing pressure, the WMHC was forced to make a public statement; the number of 27 cases of corona infection has been officially confirmed. Afterwards, the top Chinese health authority, the NHC in Beijing, sent a group of experts to Wuhan. At the latest there had been reports of a possible mass-spreading disease in the Chinese capital.\nIn the meantime, the Wuhan fish and wildlife market continued to dominate. A journalist interviewed the dealers, where no one had heard of the virus. Wild animals were sold further. Only after this report appeared on the government's First Finance news page from Shanghai did the market become the first. January 2020 closed.\nAt that time there were already eight people who were investigated by the police for \"spreading rumors\" about the virus disease. News spokesmen announced the arrests on local and central government channels such as China Central TV with a stern look: \"The Internet is not a free space!\" Not a word was lost on what alleged rumors the alleged perpetrators had spread.\nI have 11. In January, the doctor who was initially rehabilitated became ill. Diagnosis: pneumonia. The Coronavirus? Even more than two weeks later, the physician was still severely affected, he was not told about the medical findings on his own body. Many infected patients have suffered the same fate. Of the people who had already confirmed more than 200 to the consequences of the Coronavirus in China, at least initially, many apparently did not know what they were suffering from at all.\nThe Chinese government has long obstructed the search for the truth with ever-new blurring tactics. Officials threw out to the public only little information, dubious statistics, mixed with increasingly angry statements of determination to win the \"war against the plague\".\nA case of obvious cover-up is, for example, the fact that the city government of Wuhan of the 3rd. up to 15. In January, no new cases of infection reported as if the virus had been stopped by magic. Experienced observers were able to see through the spell: it happened to be precisely the days during which the People's Congress of Hubei Province was held in the city (Wuhan is the capital of Hubei). It was the same game as at the beginning of the Sars crisis in 2002/2003: at that time the government in Beijing had had the epidemic however for months.\nspiritually denied for the sake of \"stability\" around the Peking National Congress in the spring. 17-years have passed since then without really passing.\nAn article from the specialist magazine The Lancet was published on 24th. January retroactive that on the 2nd. In January 41 hospital patients and patients in Wuhan presented laboratory-based infections with the virus now called 2019-nCoV. Five days before this publication, Wuhan's head of health care, Wang Guangfa, had told journalists that the new Coronavirus was \"not very contagious\", that the risk of transmission from person to person was \"low\". The disease can be \"prevented and controlled\". Where Wang Guangfa got his information and whether he himself did not already know better cannot be said. In any case, two days after the press conference, he himself became ill from this not very contagious disease.\nAnd People's Daily reported online that the cause of the diseases is not yet known, whether it is Sars or, more likely, a less dangerous disease. \"But even if it is saris, we have a sophisticated system of prevention and control. There is no reason to panic for the people of Wuhan.\"\nThe inhabitants of the city were calm and continued their holiday preparations. In the coming weeks, five million of them flocked to spend the end of January's New Year's Eve with their families. Thousands traveled abroad. Meanwhile, social media posts have been appearing in which people have reported strange diseases to their relatives or acquaintances in Beijing, Changsha, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and soon to Japan and Thailand. The Chinese media froze. No one dared investigate these new cases. There was a loose tone in the state media, and the short reports on the disease highlighted the competence of the government and spread optimism.\nOnly in Hong Kong was the situation taken very seriously very early on. I got four. In January, seven suspected cases of the disease were reported. The government there immediately took strict precautions, with great transparency in information policy. The relatively independent press played an important role in this. The television stations reported around the clock. Journalists and journalists were sent to mainland China to investigate; However, some of them were immediately thrown out of there or questioned by the police.\nAlready at seven. In January, Starry Lee, chairman of the Beijing-loyal Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, then travelled to the Chinese capital and asked the central government to improve the flow of information around the epidemic. Among the relevant reports in online media, government trolls and patriots then came to them: \"Then you can't demonstrate! Your Hong Kong makes so much environmental pollution!\"\nWhen there was scarcely anything left to hide and embellish, the governments of Hubei Province and Wuhan continued to hold all kinds of galas and events for the celebration of the Chinese New Year's Eve. Still on 18th. In January, the city organized a feast for 40.000 families who cooked and ate together. The participants clearly believed the official slogans: trust the government! No one seemed aware of the situation that the Coronavirus could also celebrate a feast here.\nI got 19. In January, the state media suddenly announced with great Tamtam the return of a now 84-year-old hero from the fight against Sars in the 2003 year: Out of the blue Zhong Nanshan, lung specialist and former president of the Chinese Medical Association, was called to a medical-propaganda battle. He managed to squeeze himself into the dining cars of a fast-track in the south of Guangzhou. In Wuhan he was written and immediately continued to Beijing the next day to report to the health authority. I'm twenty. In January, he confessed to journalists that the transmission of the virus from person to person was possible and at that time 14 representatives of the medical staff were already infected. After this brilliant interview, he went underground.\nOnly now did the media decide to ignore the government's seemingly existing muzzle. Brave journalists and journalists of the few remaining traditional media travelled to Wuhan to investigate on the spot. Many online rumors were confirmed: hospitals were actually overloaded and had to reject numerous patients, doctors and nurses were sick, officials had lied and concealed, there were apparently not enough test kits to test all patients for the virus.\nIn the official news, hospitals had been provided with at least 100.000 of these test kits, and patients were provided with 4.000 beds, while the number of confirmed infections and suspected cases was still three digits. But where were those test kits and the hospital beds? And where was the \"sufficient quantity\" of masks, gloves and protective clothing? How could the pleading calls from reputable hospitals from all over China for all this be explained?\nWhat about the heartbreaking appeals of children in social media who are desperate for treatment for their parents, grandparents and themselves? Who are the people in the online videos who just roll over on the street at the top of the hospital queuing up? What about the young woman who, in vain, tries to get one office after another to accept her grandmother's body at home? What about the doctor who breaks down and yells, \"Get rid of those lying in the hallway! Now!\" With the social-media viral video of the nurse crying hysterically during her lunch break?\nFor other things, the government agencies apparently had time and money: the best telecommunication technology in the world is said to have been used to monitor all mobile users in the province of Hubei and to report to other provinces the number of visitors from the endangered region. Some local authorities also reported their names, addresses and ID numbers. Travelers from Hubei were rejected in hotels. Some were misled on the open road, insulted or even beaten, it is reported. The local authorities prepared accommodation for the unwelcome refugees, but then failed to tell people where to find the accommodation.\nPeople have now recognized the logic (or illogical) of the \"fight against the virus\": In hospitals, even the admitted patients have apparently tested only part of the virus. The relatively small number of confirmed infections (now officially over 17.000 people in China) that initially appeared to be relatively small due to the huge containment measures, for example in Wuhan, can be explained at least in part by this and also by that apparently just a lot of patients were rejected and not treated at all. The data and statistics transmitted from China to the Coronavirus should in any case only be believed with reservation.\nIn the Chinese network, the sick and their relatives, when they speak on social media, are now being harassed by trolls. They accuse patients of being simulators or enemy agents, demand proof of their plight and then discredit that evidence. An example is the case of a young woman who, like her father and grandmother, was infected and rejected by a hospital. She asked for help from a woman. Thousands of hate comments gathered under their mail. She begged and she was furious, and then all that was left on her account was the word \"deceased.\" The government maintains a zombie army of paid hate commentators. Not all trolls are part of it, but their culture feeds their hatred.\nThe leader of the nation and creator of the \"Dream of China\", Chairman Xi Jinping, has so far not visited Wuhan or any of the hospitals in the country where people suffering from the Coronavirus are treated. Instead, he gave a vague and prominent speech, signalling the will to fight, but also emphasising his government's \"stability and great vision\". Even the one on 27. In January, a late-deployed \"epidemic prevention team\" was not in front of Xi, but Prime Minister Li Keqiang. Only after a meeting with the Director-General of the\nThe World Health Organization still put Xi at the top.\nFor many Chinese, this is a time of \"Truth Overdemand\". It is impossible to list all that they have had to experience in recent weeks. But one thing is certain: the image of the Chinese Government as an embodiment of efficiency, unlimited resources and unquestionable authority, on which the government itself has been working for decades, is badly damaged. Meanwhile, some fear a total collapse of the Chinese economy due to the epidemic. However strong the resilience of the Chinese leadership may be, it is the first time in a long time that it has shown cracks. These could get bigger. For the basic capital of the government, however unfaithful it may have been acquired, is in danger: faced with the threat of a virus, many people now realize that propaganda is not a medical cure.\nGerman by Jakob Klagen\n", "label": 0, "id": 2121}, {"content": "Apple employee tests positive for coronavirus at US office.

It was a signal that China has largely won the fight against the epidemic. \n On Wednesday, the Hubei government issued a notice asking companies to resume operations in an orderly manner, although residents are still restricted from leaving the province. Hubei has been divided into three categories \u2014\u00a0with regions classified as high, middle and low risk. \n Companies in low-risk regions can gradually resume business, while in high-risk areas, companies involved in epidemic prevention and control, public services and supply of daily necessities are allowed to reopen. \n For the medical staff who have been fighting the virus in Wuhan, these are welcome signs that the day they can return to their own homes is approaching. \n Tian Xi, 33, a volunteer with the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation in Beijing, went to Wuhan on the first day of the Lunar New Year \u2013 two days after the city went into lockdown. \n He has been helping organisations deliver medical supplies to hospitals \u2013 five times a day during the peak of the epidemic \u2013 as well as sending patients and doctors to hospitals and delivering masks to residents. In the past weeks he has seen despairing people jump from a bridge in front of him and dead patients lying for hours in hospitals, with no one to handle them. \n \u201cThe situation in the past week has obviously been better as we have received fewer requests for help,\u201d Tian said. \u201cNow the battle has gone to the second half and I hope it can end soon.\u201d \n Nanjing nurse Mary Li has been working in intensive care units in Wuhan treating Covid-19 patients for almost a month.

According to the latest data from Bloomberg, China is still trying to curb the spread of this new coronavirus. According to the latest data, coronavirus has killed at least 41 people, infected more than 1100 people in China and 16 people in other countries. In addition to isolating and closing the traffic in the crisis center Wuhan and more than a dozen surrounding cities, affecting more than 41 million people, he also plans to build a new hospital in Wuhan within 10 days to focus on the treatment of these patients.\nAccording to CCTV, the hospital will be built in the western suburb of the city with a population of 11 million, next to the former workers' rest area. The project started on Thursday and is expected to be completed on Monday, February 3.\nThe idea of building a new hospital and transferring people infected with coronavirus to there replicates what was done during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. The disease is related to the current Wuhan 2019-ncov coronavirus, causing more than 700 deaths. Subsequently, Beijing ordered the construction of a specialized clinic called xiaotangshang in the northern suburbs of the capital. About 7000 workers built it in a week.\nAlthough the original idea was to use these facilities to take care of SARS survivors, so as to reduce the pressure on other hospitals, Xiaotang finally treated nearly 700 SARS patients in the acute phase, accounting for one seventh of the total number of infected people at that time. The hospital is famous for reducing the patient mortality rate to 1.18% (of which only 8 died), which earned it the nickname of \"Noah's Ark\". The World Health Organization (who) estimates that the mortality rate of the syndrome is 9.6%.\nAccording to Changjiang Daily, the official newspaper of Wuhan, the new hospital in Wuhan will accommodate 1000 beds. In order to speed up the work, prefabricated modules are selected. \"By using these materials, it is not only built quickly, but also quite cheap,\" the newspaper pointed out.\nThe purpose of the new facility is to reduce the pressure on other hospitals in the city, which have been completely flooded by the epidemic: the main health care center publicly called for the donation of various protective materials on Friday, From disposable sanitary masks to glasses and surgical clothes. According to the state-owned newspaper newspaper, the hospital will only have such equipment in the next three to five days.\nAlthough the city has accelerated the construction of hospitals, and the Hubei provincial government has sought financial assistance from the central government to deal with the crisis, the number of infected people continues to grow. In the past 24 hours, the National Health Commission has confirmed two coronavirus deaths outside Hubei Province. The first one in Hebei Province (Northern China) is an 80 year old man who spent two months in that city. The second was in the distant Heilongjiang Province, bordering Russia in Northeast China. On Friday night, Bloomberg quoted a statement from the Hubei provincial government as saying that another 15 people died, bringing the death toll caused by the virus to 41.\nAccording to Caijing, a medical source in Wuhan, health workers in Wuhan estimated that the number of people affected would reach about 6000. Although so far, most of the deaths are over 70 years old and have suffered from other diseases, the death of a 36 year old man was confirmed on Friday. He did not suffer from any chronic diseases. The patient from Hubei Province was hospitalized with pneumonia on January 9. He died on Thursday.\nSo far, as a preventive measure to reduce the spread of coronavirus, Wuhan and more than a dozen nearby cities have been isolated and their transportation networks have been closed.\nDoor. The source of the virus is a wild animal sales market in Wuhan, which leads to atypical pneumonia, with symptoms including high fever and dyspnea.\nThe outbreak of this epidemic coincides with the travel season of the lunar new year, which is the season with the largest annual population flow in the world. It is estimated that nearly 3 billion people are displaced, increasing the possibility of virus transmission. At least eight other countries have found cases: Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal and the United States.\nPreventive measures were expanded nationwide. Facing the Lunar New Year celebrations on Saturday, most cities have cancelled public activities that the public can focus on. \"People must be careful not to gather together and try to stay at home during the New Year celebrations to protect themselves\", Gao Fu, director of China Center for Disease Control and prevention, said in an interview with CCTV.\nBeijing and Shanghai authorities require those who leave dangerous areas to stay at home for 14 days. In Beijing, among other activities, the popular Temple Fair has been suspended. The temple fair is one of the most popular pastimes in celebrations. The Forbidden City and other frequently visited tourist attractions, including the zoo and the Great Wall, have been closed until the new order. In Shanghai, Disneyland has also temporarily stopped operation.\nMajor cinema chains have also announced temporary closures, According to the professional magazine Hollywood Reporter, about 70000 television stations across the country will suspend screening, which is one of the periods with the largest audience and the tradition of some major premieres this year.

Each week, TODAY\u2019s long-running Big Read series delves into trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at Singapore\u2019s preparedness in the early days of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here. \n SINGAPORE\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Like many others on the frontline during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, a family clinic in Chua\u00a0Chu Kang faced difficulty getting the\u00a0 equipment needed to protect themselves from the killer virus. \n Despite aid from the authorities, Dr Tan Tze Lee, a general practitioner (GP) at the Edinburgh Clinic said it was still difficult for frontline healthcare workers to obtain supplies such as N95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns.\u00a0 \n By the time Sars was contained in May 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. \n Everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, the president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore.\u00a0 \n \u201cThe healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event. Here we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,\u201d he said. \n The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus \u2014 or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) temporary name for the virus \u2014 was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic.\u00a0 \n The WHO has yet to declare the virus \u2014 which has spread to several countries \u2014 as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31).\u00a0 \n The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China\u2019s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals.\u00a0 \n At the heart of the city-state\u2019s response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (Dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after Sars and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009.\u00a0 \n While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore\u2019s national strategy is still largely untested \u2014 since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and Sars veterans told TODAY.\u00a0 \n However, there are ample signs that the lessons from Sars are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during Sars, Singapore is far more ready now. \n LESSONS LEARNT \n Sars, which first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003 from Hong Kong, was initially an unknown. First diagnosed at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), an MOH task force was set up on two weeks later, after the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert on the outbreak. \n But the command and control structure was \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, one study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012. \n The study by two researchers from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy said that a response required \u201cmore than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH\u201d. \n It took five weeks after the first case was reported before the bureaucracy adapted. On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to Sars, comprising of a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng. \n In the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, the same day when the first suspected case \u2014 which later turned out to be positive \u2014 emerged. \n Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. \n As a result, there is a clearer chain of command, said Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Governmental Parliamentary Committee on Health. \n Singapore is not in the same po\nsition as it was in the initial stages of the Sars outbreak in 2003, which then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang once described in Parliament as \u201cflying blind\u201d. \n Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said back then \u201cthere were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly\u201d. \n This meant that policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. Today, however, these protocols are already in place. \n Since 2003, Singapore has beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003, with new hospitals and the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases. \n Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too \u2014 student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound School on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site. \n Unlike during Sars, which centralised treatments at TTSH, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today. \n When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators which required a custom fitting. Today, most healthcare workers, including new staff, already have their own gear. \n The SMA also met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out \u201ccomplex logistics arrangements\u201d to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. \n TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES \n Mr Lawrence Wong has called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than Sars given the many \u201cimponderables\u201d and \u201cuncertainties\u201d regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. \n Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. \n Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore\u2019s approach \u201cis to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can\u201d. \u201cBut every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,\u201d he added.\u00a0 \n Unlike Sars, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is a greater understanding about the coronavirus such as the Wuhan strain and Sars. \n But data gaps still exist, including information about the true epidemic potential of the virus, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO\u2019s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva.\u00a0 \n Despite the data gaps, Singapore has \u201creacted much more swiftly and comprehensively\u201d than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added. \u201cI think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available -- robust but not over-reactive, and flexible enough to accommodate new\u00a0 developments,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \n He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Underreaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus.\u00a0 \n Singapore\u2019s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances. For example, the plan recommends taking border control measures that would \u201cerr on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer\u201d. \n HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS\u00a0 \n Although the memory of Sars may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis.\u00a0 \n For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour. \u00a0 But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital,\u00a0 believes that the prospect of another Sars-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, \u201ckiasuism\u201d.\u00a0 \n In a viral outbreak, being \u201ckiasu\u201d meant that\npeople only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said. \n Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. At the same time, Singapore\u2019s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. \n Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. \n \u201cDuring Sars, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening\u2026 But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,\u201d he said. \n STRONGER LEGISLATION\u00a0 \n The rise of social media, which was non-existent during Sars, can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. \n Compared with the Sars crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour \u2014 the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. \n Changes to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years have also given authorities greater powers to enforce orders to fight a gazetted outbreak, such as using \u201cphysical means\u201d to enforce a home quarantine order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation. \n The breadth of such powers in Singapore give authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics cannot happen again. \n MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS\u00a0 \n Over a longer term, legislatives measures are less effective than instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. \n Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when authorities need the public\u2019s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu. \n This largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation. \n Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in 2003 that \u201cquick dissemination of information \u2013 and accurate information \u2013 is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency\u201d. \n Prof Pangestu pointed out that public reaction is \u201chard to control especially with fake news on social media\u201d.\u00a0 \n \u201cThe idea that \u2018perception is reality, anything is the truth\u2019 often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. That is why public risk communication is so important,\u201d he said\n", "label": 1, "id": 2142}, {"content": "japan services sector activity shrinks on coronavirus hit - pmi.

However, many Chinese also use the holiday to go overseas.\nA person who works for China\u2019s official train ticketing service told Reuters on Friday that there were no additional health screening measures or temperature checks in place at Wuhan train stations.\nSince Wednesday, people traveling from Wuhan\u2019s Tianhe International airport have been subject to temperature tests before boarding flights, according to an official notice.\nTwo flight attendants staffing separate domestic flights in and out of the city said they had not received additional training or warnings about the virus.\nBut people who have been affected are worried.\n\u201cI look at a public handrail or food or people standing close together and it makes me feel anxious,\u201d said a 33-year-old woman surnamed Peng, who lives roughly one km (a half-mile) from the seafood market where the virus is suspected to have originated and says her elderly aunt was hospitalized with flu-like symptoms late last week.\nThe illness is not a confirmed case of coronavirus, she told Reuters by phone, but two relatives canceled plans to visit the pair for the new year.\nPeng declined to share her full name because hospital authorities and police have warned Wuhan residents against speaking about the virus online or to media.\n\u201cThere is no holiday for me ... only worry,\u201d she said.\nOne woman, whose elderly parents have been hospitalized with flu-like conditions, said she had been ordered to take full precautions even though her parents were not confirmed to have been infected by the virus.\n\u201cI can only deliver food to the door. We can\u2019t get in, we can\u2019t see each other, and we can only talk by phone,\u201d she said of her visits to the hospital.\n\u201cWe wear two layers of masks every day, we don\u2019t go to crowded places, and we disinfect and wash our hands.\u201d\nAs the number of new cases continues to rise, locals say authorities are cracking down on people who post online information on the virus or sick relatives.\nEarlier this month, state media said eight people had been \u201cdealt with according to l\naw\u201d in cases related to sharing information about the virus on social media.\nTwo people told Reuters they had been ordered by police to remove social media posts. They declined to share their names.\nSeveral source who spoke to Reuters said admittance departments at hospitals in Wuhan were unusually busy and many people with flu symptoms were told to return home.\n\u201cPeople are scared,\u201d said Peng. \u201cMost people maybe have a regular flu or cold\u2026 but where is the person who takes that chance?\u201d\n", "label": 0, "id": 2144}, {"content": "Covid-19!

Coronavirus outbreak has been reported from 75 countries after originating in Wuhan in China in mid-December, and first reporting in mid-January. Sitting next to epicentre of coronavirus outbreak, India managed to keep Covid-19 or Coronavirus Disease 2019 largely at bay for more than two months.\nNow, at least 28 people have tested positive for Covid-19, the Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said. First three cases were reported from Kerala in February. There were isolated and discharged after a successful treatment.\nIndia evacuated around 200 people from Wuhan and kept them in quarantine at a camp in the outskirts of Delhi. They too were released after 14 days of quarantine.\nWhen it seemed that India might have pulled out a miracle of sort in insulating itself from an international contagion, two fresh cases over the weekends shook up the nation. Rush to medical stores became frantic in every major city and, hand sanitisers and face masks of all kinds became scarce once again.\nOf the two cases, one was reported from Delhi sending the media in alarm mode with government agencies asking people not to panic and follow advisory, most important of which requires keeping hands clean either with soap or alcohol-based sanitisers, minimise hand-face contact, staying away from infected persons and report to a hospital if there are symptoms such as sore throat, breathlessness combined with other indicators of flu.\nReporting to hospitals in case of symptoms is key to preventing further spread of coronavirus infection. Scientists are yet to conclusively ascertain that how many healthy persons may be infected by one Covid-19 patient. Some Covid-19 patients may infect more persons than other carriers. Quarantine and isolation - depending on when the carrier reports contact with infected person or infection - is a must for such persons.\nCOVID-19 SUPER SPREADER\nDiscovery of one such patient during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS outbreak in 2003 had led to use of the term, \"super spreader\", which is not officially recognised by government agencies or the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nIn the case of coronavirus outbreak the first super spreader was identified in South Korea. Now, she is known as \"Patient 31\" and is held responsible for spreading corornavirus to \"countless\" people.\nShe is a member of a little known religious sect, Shincheonji Church of Jesus. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has filed a formal complaint against the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, accusing it of murder.\nThe reason is that the Patient 31 continued to attend public gatherings including at restaurants, markets and church apparently ignoring the advice of doctors. The sentiment in South Korea is that she should have taken her case seriously and presented herself to health authorities.\nTHE INDIAN CASE\nIn India, the prompt action in the initial stage by the Kerala health authorities in shifting the first Covid-19 patients to isolation and the Indian government in keeping the Wuhan evacuees in quarantine killed the chances of anyone turning into a super spreader.\nBut with the reporting of fresh cases has revived the fear. The Delhi coronavirus patient, a 45-year-old man, returned from a Europe tour on February 25. He had been to Italy on a road trip.\nItaly is one of the worst-affected countries in the grip of coronavirus outbreak. But his screening could not be done at the airport as the government put Italy on the watch-list only on February 26 when reports of coronavirus infection from the country became too frequent.\nOn his return, he went about his daily routine as usual. He threw birthday party for his son, where students of two prominent schools in Noida were also present. The two schools had now been shut.\nAfter a few days, when the man showed symptoms of Covid-19, he reported to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. The government authorities are still in the process of contact-tracing all those, this patient came in contact.\nSix of his relatives from Agra in Uttar Pradesh became coronavirus patients after he visited them upon his return from Europe tour.\nIGNORANCE IS LOSS, NOT BLISS\nThe other patient is a software engineer, who works in Bengaluru but belongs to Hyderabad. He had been to Dubai, where his coworkers were from Hong Kong, a country severely affected by coronavirus outbreak.\nHe returned from Dubai on February 19/20 and reported to his office. Few days\nlater, he took a bus to Hyderabad, where he showed symptoms of Covid-19 and approached a private hospital first. He was referred to a government hospital, where his coronavirus infection was confirmed.\nThe government authorities are in the process of contact-tracing of all the people the infected techie might have come in contact with including the passengers of the bus. More than 100 people are being monitored for suspected coronavirus infection.\nCOVID-19 FROM ITALY GUESTS\nThe biggest case of coronavirus infection reported in India is of a group of Italian tourists who arrived in Rajasthan in the last week of February. The group had been travelling till a 69-year-man of the troupe was confirmed as a Covid-19 patient. They went to places including Agra. They were assisted by Indian tour operators and guides.\nNow, 15 of the Italian group have tested positive and shifted to specialised camp in the outskirts of Delhi. The authorities are on contact-tracing hunt to screen all those people who came in contact with this group and advise quarantine measures to all the suspects.\nA driver who was ferried the Italian group has also tested positive for coronavirus.\nHOW NOT TO BE SUPER SPREADER\nIt is important to understand who can be a coronavirus carrier. Practically, anyone who has come in direct or indirect contact with a Covid-19 patient or carrier. Normally, an infected person would show symptoms and once reported, the doctors would keep the patient in isolation.\nBut some other persons, with robust immune system, may be able to suppress the symptoms and yet pass on the virus to people with vulnerable immunity. Since the coronavirus spreader may not show symptoms due to strong immunity, he or she might continue to infect others, and become a super spreader.\nSecondly, not every coronavirus carrier or patient houses same load of virus. Those with greater load are capable of infecting greater number of people.\nEach one of the Covid-19 patients diagnosed in India was a potential super spreader. Italian group remained unscreened and non-quarantined for far too long. The Delhi man reported days after his visit to Italy, and the country having been placed on the watchlist. Reporting of his travel to Italy on February 26 would have containing the spread of coronavirus, and saved even his own relatives.\nBengaluru techie too did not report to health authorities despite having come in contact with professionals from Hong Kong, which was already infested by Covid-19. He was not screened, quarantined or isolated for days after he is suspected to have contracted coronavirus infection.\nReporting his contact with Hong Kong nationals would have saved several people in at least two cities - Bengaluru and Hyderabad - from the scare of possible coronavirus infection.\nAll these Covid-19 patients went ahead with their usual routine not realising that they could be coronavirus carriers, and potential super spreaders. It is time to report. Remember the old saying, prevention is better than cure.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2147}, {"content": "New type of viral pneumonia detected in China is second dead.

TOKYO - A surgeon and a patient at the same Wakayama hospital, near Osaka, have been infected with the coronavirus, officials said on Friday (Feb 14), with three other new cases surfacing in Tokyo and Okinawa. \n These developments come a day after Japan reported its first coronavirus-related death - a woman in her 80s in Kanagawa prefecture, south of Tokyo. \n Japan's 35th case is a female taxi driver in her 60s in Okinawa, who is suspected to have ferried passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship when they disembarked in the prefectural capital of Naha on Feb 1. \n The country's 36th and 37th cases are both linked to an infected Tokyo taxi driver, who is the son-in-law of the elderly woman who died. The man, who is in his 70s, had attended a new year's gathering on board a 'yakatabune' boat cruise last month. \n An employee of the yakatabune, as well as an employee of a taxi driver's union, were confirmed to have been infected on Friday. \n Domestic media cited experts as wondering if a \"stealth outbreak\" might already be underway in Japan. \n Tohoku University Professor Hitoshi Oshitani told Jiji Press that efforts should be devoted to reducing the speed of contagion and treating the severely ill, as an epidemic is \"likely occurring to some extent\". \n None of the new cases have cited any recent overseas travel, let alone to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. This has left officials perplexed as to how an emerging bunch of cases around Tokyo and in Wakayama - which borders Osaka - have occurred. \n In Wakayama, officials on Friday confirmed that a patient at the Saiseikai Arida Hospital was suffering from Covid-19, a day after they said a surgeon had been infected. \n The farmer, in his 70s, is in serious condition. But officials stressed that doctor-to-patient transmission was unlikely, as the farmer was not treated by the infected surgeon. \n They raised the possibility that both men were infected outside hospital grounds. \n At least three others at the hospital - a doctor and two another patients - have developed symptoms of pneumonia and are being tested for the coronavirus. \n The surgeon, who is in his 50s, was on Thursday (Feb 13) confirmed to be suffering from Covid-19, first medical professional to be infected in Japan. \n Authorities are conducting urgent contact tracing to see if he had contracted the coronavirus from a patient and how many others he might have passed it to. \n He first developed a slight fever on Jan 31, but returned to work from Feb 3 to 5 after taking medicine to bring down his fever. He developed a 38 deg C fever last Saturday, and a CT scan revealed symptoms of pneumonia. \n Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the central government will send an infectious diseases expert to the Saiseikai Arida Hospital. \n A day earlier, a woman in her 80s died in Kanagawa prefecture, south of Tokyo, but it was only during the post-mortem after her death that doctors found that she was infected with the coronavirus. \n She first saw the doctor for lethargy on Jan 22, and was hospitalised for pneumonia on Feb 1. \n \"The relationship between the coronavirus and the person's death is still unclear,\" Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said. \"Testing was conducted because she was suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.

SINGAPORE - Singapore's\u00a0central bank said on Wednesday (Feb 5) that its current exchange-rate band has enough room to accommodate an easing of the local\u00a0currency, even as monetary policy stance remains unchanged. \n The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was responding to media queries about its monetary\u00a0policy stance, given that traders are betting that central banks will loosen the policy to support the economy due to the coronavirus outbreak. \n The Bank of Thailand cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low on Wednesday as the coronavirus spread, which\u00a0originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, put even more pressure on the struggling economy.\u00a0 \n The Singapore dollar slid to a four-month low after the MAS statement on Wednesday, trading down 0.7 per cent to 1.3812 to the US dollar as of 1:30pm from Tuesday\u2019s close. It earlier fell as much as 1 per cent to 1.3853. \n The MAS said that the Singdollar has been fluctuating near the upper bound of the policy band since its last review in\u00a0October, when it reduced slightly the Singdollar appreciation rate, the first easing since April 2016. \n \u201cThere is therefore sufficient room in the band... to ease in line with any weakness in the Singapore economy in the coming months,\u201d the MAS said. \n A weaker currency, corresponding to policy easing, makes imports more expensive in Singdollar terms, while making Singapore exports more competitive. \n The Singdollar is weighed against a basket of currencies, and it is allowed to fluctuate within an unspecified band, unlike most central banks that use interest rates to manage\u00a0their currencies. The MAS regulates the Singdollar by buying or selling the currency when it goes out of the band.\u00a0 \n The MAS added that it is \u201cmonitoring economic developments closely\u201d and that the next half-yearly monetary policy review \u201cremains as scheduled\u201d in April this year. \n DBS Bank foreign exchange strategist Philip Wee said: \u201cThe MAS statement tells us that there will be no urgency for an inter-meeting easing in the Singdollar policy before the next scheduled policy review.\u201d \n He notes that the appreciation of the Singdollar \u201chas held in the stronger half of the policy band throughout the United States-China trade war\u201d. \n \u201cSingapore averted a technical recession because the impact from the trade war was not broad-based and confined mostly to trade and manufacturing,\u201d he added. \n \u201cGiven the potential negative spillover from the coronavirus into domestic demand and services... it is not unreasonable for the (Singapore) currency to reposition at a more neutral level, currently just below the mid-point of the policy band,\u201d said Mr Wee. \n He predicts that a further deterioration in the coronavirus outbreak would keep the Singdollar in the lower half of the band - between $1.376 to $1.403 against the US dollar.\u00a0 \n The bank is keeping to its Singdollar forecast of $1.40 against the greenback by March. \n Maybank foreign exchange research head Saktiandi Supaat said: \u201cThe severity of the outbreak and its impact on the local economy, especially the tourism industry and sectors such as manufacturing tied to Chinese demand, will likely come into policy consideration (for the upcoming review).\u201d \n He noted that potential measures targeted at the tourism and consumer sectors, as announced by the Government might also help allay market concerns. \n He added: \u201cBut our baseline view is still that the outbreak would be contained at some point,\u201d he added.\u00a0 \n CIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun said that the virus outbreak has made it clear that Singapore is in for a tough first quarter, but the economic forecast remains unchanged so far. \n \u201cWe are not in that period of great uncertainty yet,\u201d he said, adding that economic indicators such as growth and inflation have not began flashing warning signs.\u00a0 \n Correction: The headline of an earlier version of the article said there is \"sufficient room\" for monetary policy to ease. That is incorrect.\u00a0 It should be \"sufficient room\" for the Singapore dollar to ease within MAS' current policy band.

TOKYO \u2014 Japan on Friday (Feb 14) vowed to step up testing and containment efforts for Covid-19 after suffering its first death and the confirmation of new cases, including a doctor and a taxi driver. \n The biggest cluster of coronavirus infections outside China is on a cruise liner quarantined in a Japanese port, with 218 people on board confirmed as infected and taken off to hospital. \n On Friday, some of the ship's passengers were allowed to disembark \u2014 with priority given to older passengers who have been confined to windowless cabins \u2014 to complete their quarantine on shore. \n A woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture, west of Tokyo, became Japan's first fatality from the virus, the health ministry said on Thursday. \n She had been transferred between hospitals as her condition worsened and was only confirmed as having Covid-19 after her death. \n Her death brings to three the number of fatalities from the virus outside mainland China, where the virus emerged in the city of Wuhan in December and some 1,367 people have died. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. \n There are nearly 450 confirmed cases in some 24 countries and territories outside China, with 33 in Japan as well as the 218 from the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which has been moored in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, since Feb 3. \n A Tokyo taxi driver, who Japanese media said was the woman's son-in-law, as well as a man in his 20s just east of Tokyo and a doctor in Wakayama, western Japan, were also confirmed to have the virus. \n \"We will stay in touch with local governments and expand our testing procedures and treatment of patients in order to prevent the spread,\" prime minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, a day after a task force on the disease drew up measures to deal with it, including spending 10.3 billion yen from budget reserves. \n Officials in Wakayama later said a man who had been hospitalised at the hospital where the doctor worked had tested positive for the virus and was in serious condition, and that several other people were being observed. \n GETTING OFF THE SHIP \n Health minister Katsunobu Kato said there was no evidence the coronavirus was spreading widely in Japan, although he said that it might, and the government needed prepare for that. \n But Dr Hiroshi Oshitani, a professor of virology at Tohoku University School of Medicine, said the situation in Japan had entered a new stage. \n \"There's the chance that many people may have been infected by each of these people,\" Dr Oshitani said, adding that he thought containing the virus may be impossible. \n \"We can't contain it but we can slow its spread. How to do that is the question, we can't lock things down as they did in Wuhan.\" \n Unease about the virus in Japan is spreading on social media, with some sceptics saying the government's response resembled its reaction to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, when it took time for the true extent of the disaster to emerge. \n \"All their comments then were 'there's no immediate danger to health' now they're saying 'in an epidemiological sense' it's not spreading,\" wrote one with the handle Kanzu. \n \"They're trying to misrepresent it all.\" \n The passengers who got off the Diamond Princess were taken away in several buses to complete their quarantine. \n The alarm was first raised on the ship after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. Its quarantine is set to end on Feb 19. \n About 80 per cent of the ship's passengers are 60 years old or older, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in their 90s, according to media. \n The ship, managed by Princess Cruise Lines and owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp, typically has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670.

The new Coronavirus, which is spreading from China, has only been known for weeks. Most of what is currently being published by scientists and reported by the media is provisional. Understanding the new virus is a process. Read here what can be considered safe, likely and still uncertain.\nThe new virus is related to Sars and Mers\nThe new virus with the provisional name 2019-nCoV is a pathogen from the Coronavir family. These viruses can infect humans and various animals. In humans, they can cause harmless colds up to deadly diseases. Coronaviruses are also the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Sars, and Mers, which stands for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. During the largest Sars epidemic in the 2002 and 2003 years, 774 people died worldwide. More than 800 people have died at Mers since 2012. Like its relatives, the new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV can cause severe pneumonia in some infected patients.\nCommon symptoms are fever and cough\nSome infected have few or no signs of disease, others are seriously ill or even die of pneumonia. Symptoms that are quite common according to the first scientific publications are fever, cough and shortness of breath. But muscle and headache as well as diarrhoea can also occur (The Lancet: Chen et al., 2020). When doctors examine patients in hospital by computer tomography, they often see signs of bilateral pneumonia.\nThe outbreak originated in Wuhan\nStarting from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the virus has spread further. The Lancet: Huang et al. 2020. The Lancet was the first to be infected with this disease. Thousands of cases are now known, most of them in China. However, more than twenty other states have reported infections with 2019-nCoV. In early February, the first death outside China was also reported, in the Philippines. The World Health Organisation (WHO) regularly publishes the latest outbreak figures on its website. Whether a wildlife market was the origin of the outbreak is uncertain.\nThe virus originated from bats\nChinese scientists have examined the inheritance of the new Coronavirus in samples from lung secretions from infected patients. It resembles the Sars-Coronavirus, originally derived from bats, to approximately 79 percent (The Lancet: Lu et al., 2020). More closely related, however, is 2019-nCoV with Sars-like viruses found in bats. The inheritance was identical in these cases to 88 percent. \"It is very certain that the virus was originally circulated in bats,\" says the virologist Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine in Hamburg. It is not certain that it went directly from bats to humans.\nThe virus is transmitted like a flu\nThe new pathogen, like other coronary viruses or the flu virus, the flu virus, is probably primarily transmitted through the air. When an infected person exhales, sneezes or coughs, they distribute microscopic droplets in the air that may contain the virus. In addition to this droplet infection, other transmission routes are conceivable: Sars, a close relative of the new Coronavirus, was also transmitted to a lesser extent over surfaces. This means that someone who sneezes in their hands, for example, and then touches a doorknob, can infect another person who shortly thereafter takes the same doorknob in their hand and then touches their mouth with his hand. \"Especially in the case of newly infected, such lubricating infections are not excluded even in the current outbreak,\" says Schmidt-Chanasit. However, one assumes a drop infection as the main route of transmission. In addition, the new Coronavirus is a cloaked virus. Such viruses are usually less stable in the environment, so they are unlikely to survive on surfaces for longer.\nThe elderly and the elderly appear to be particularly at risk\nEarly data suggest that the virus makes especially older people create. Analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases\nle was almost every second patient 60 years or older (The New England Journal of Medicine: Li et al., 2020, PDF). And: men seem to be more affected than women after initial findings. In the study of Li and colleagues were 56 percent male, in another patient treated with 99 in a hospital in Wuhan even 67 percent (The Lancet: Chen et al., 2020). Each second of the 99 patients also suffered from a chronic disease, especially the cardiovascular system or the cerebral vessels. According to the researchers, older men with pre-existing illnesses could therefore constitute a special risk group.\nChildren are obviously not particularly at risk\nSurprisingly rare, however, children seem to be affected by the infection with 2019-nCoV. Among the first 425 confirmed infected were none among 15-year-olds (The New England Journal of Medicine: Li et al., 2020, PDF). Whether they are less susceptible to the virus or have fewer complaints is still unclear. \"Children are usually over-represented in respiratory visions,\" said the virologist Christian Drosten of the Frankfurt General Sunday newspaper. This means that you would normally expect more infections among children. Why it seems different with Sars, Mers and the new Coronavirus is not clear. It was last known that an infected employee of Webasto had infected his two children. According to the Bavarian Ministry of Health, however, they are in a stable state of health. There is currently no reason to believe that children, especially without chronic pre-existing diseases, are particularly at risk of being infected with 2019-nCoV or its consequences.\nThe incubation time is known approximately\nThe incubation period is the time between the infection and the onset of the first symptoms. According to current data, it is on average about five days (The New England Journal of Medicine: Li et al., 2020, PDF). However, it can apparently only last two or up to 14 days.\nHow many people are infected, no one can say yet\nAlthough more infected people are reported daily and included in the WHO statistics, no one knows how many people have actually contracted the new Coronavirus. This is also because many people with mild symptoms do not go to a doctor or hospital at all. Of course they will not appear in any statistics. And not everyone who goes to the doctor these days with symptoms of flu or bronchitis can and should be tested for the new pathogen according to current regulations. Experts such as Christian Drosten, a chariot virologist in Berlin and one of the discoverers of the Sars virus, assume that far more people are infected than previously known.\nA team from the University of Hong Kong (The Lancet: Wu et al., 2020) has calculated in a scenario taking into account the previously confirmed cases, air traffic and traffic flows in Central China that occur in the Wuhan area up to 25. January more than 75.000 could have infected people. However, such a calculation is currently associated with many uncertainties. Since little is known about the new virus, the researchers could only feed their computer model with rough assumptions. \"The extent to which the virus will spread depends crucially on the impact of the quarantine measures in China,\" says the Hamburg virologist Schmidt-Chanasit. If they were to be adhered to as strictly as is often reported, he believes it is possible to contain the outbreak. \"But it's hard to tell.\"\nHow deadly the virus is is further investigated\nTo find out how high the mortality is due to an infection with 2019-nCoV, you need to know two things. First, how many people are infected? And second, how many die? There is no definite answer to both, now in the middle of the outbreak. The proportion of deceased among the previously registered infected is approximately two percent. For a respiratory infection, that would be a pretty high percentage. Experts expect, however, that the more people tested, the two percent will decrease significantly in the course of the outbreak. For there will certainly be many of them with a mild course, which otherwise would not have been tested at all, i.e. would not have been statistically recorded. However, the two percent so far would be \"amazingly stable\n\"Schmidt-Chanasit said to TIME ONLINE. He expected the number to drop earlier. That is not the case, but it is also because not all tests have been evaluated yet. This could lead to an overestimation of mortality. For example, during the pandemic with the influenza virus H1N1 in the years 2009 and 2010. Initially, 59 deaths in 850 suspected cases were assumed to be extremely high mortality rates of seven percent. Later, when more data were available, the death rate decreased to below 0.1 percent. Whether the death rate will develop similarly in the current outbreak needs to show further data.\nIt is possible that the outbreak started in November\nThe Chinese authorities reported the first cases of new lung disease to the World Health Organisation at the end of December 2019. However, Chinese scientists report that at least one patient was tested positive for the new virus on December 1st (The Lancet: Huang et al. 2020) It could have been infected in November. In addition, virus samples that have been tested so far are genetically very similar, i.e. they are very likely to be related to a common ancestor. Researchers conclude that this virus is likely to have a common ancestor in a single event in November or December. It could be that the epidemic began earlier than it has been reported many times. It is possible that the epidemic may have spread from human to human since then.\nPatient zero must not have been infected on the market\nThe first person who infected an animal must not have caught the Coronavirus at the Huanan Seafood Market. In such markets live animals are offered, among others fish, seafood, poultry, but also wild birds, rats or snakes. What was sold exactly on the market in Wuhan is unclear--gene Of 99 patients treated at the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan for an infection with the Coronavirus, 49 had contact with the market (The Lancet: Chen et al., 2020) Most of them had worked there, for example as sellers or managers. Experts believe it is possible that the market is not the place where the first animal-human transmission took place. For example, the patient who was tested positive for 2019-nCoV on the first December probably had no contact with the market.\" It is possible, for example, that an animal was slaughtered and parts of it were sold on the market, but parts elsewhere \"says Schmidt-Chanasit. In this way, it would be possible for one person to get infected elsewhere and other people to get infected on the market. On the other hand, it is not plausible that a person would smuggle the virus in and then infect more people or even animals. It is therefore unclear who the patient is zero of the outbreak, just as it is unclear whether the patient was infected on the market.\nWhether bats directly infected humans is unclear\nIt is certain that large parts of the viral waste are identical to viruses that infect bats. At least the results so far do not contradict the fact that the virus could have been passed directly from bats to humans, said Virologist Schmidt-Chanasit. But there could also have been an intermediary host, another species of animal that infected bats and then infected humans again. In the case of Sars and Mers there was one such intermediary. Sars had kittens, Mers Dromedare. The Chinese researchers around Lu also assume this case. They write: \"Although our stem tree analysis suggests that bats are the original host of these viruses, an animal sold on the fish market in Wuhan may have acted as a carrier.\" The team also writes in its work that no bats were sold on the market in Wuhan, without mentioning a source (The Lancet: Lu et al., 2020).\nNo one knows the potential intermediary\nAccording to Schmidt-Chanasit, if there was an intermediary, it would have to be a mammal. The immune system of a reptile, for example a snake, was not similar enough to that of the bat and that of the human being that a transmission through snakes was plausible\nsix. \"The barrier jump from a bat to a snake and then to humans would be too big,\" says the virologist. \"That's absolutely unlikely.\" You don't know the exact species yet, you can't just read them out of the virus book. One possibility would be to test animals in the Wuhan region for viruses and to examine how similar they are to the samples from the patients. However, Schmidt-Chanasit says that a possible landlord was only briefly infected. \"Not all animals of this species have to carry the pathogen.\" This makes it all the more difficult to identify the possible host. It could also be that you never find out.\nBlood, semen or faeces as a means of transmission are not excluded\nIn addition to the infection caused by droplets of sneezing or coughing, it would also be possible to get infected by other bodily fluids. At least in the excrements of some infected remains of the pathogen's inheritance, such as in stool samples (New England Journal of Medicine: Holshue et al., 2020). Infection with faeces, however, seems to play a much smaller role than over droplets, if at all. Unlike with sars, fewer people seem to have diarrhoea with the new corona virus: with sars, it was probably ten to 20 percent. Of 99 patients treated at a clinic in Wuhan for the new Coronavirus had only two diarrhoea (The Lancet: Chen et al., 2020). \"In addition, a positive viral detection in the chair or anal smear does not necessarily mean that the virus has lived and could infect others,\" says Virologist Schmidt-Chanasit. This evidence is still pending. However, it is possible that 2019-nCoV could multiply not only in the lung, but also in the intestine and other parts of the body. \"That, too, would not be unusual.\" You can tell by examining the tissues of the patients who died as a result of the virus during autopsies. Peter Collignon, a professor of medicine at the University of Canberra, also believes that an infection via the gastrointestinal tract cannot be ruled out. The Bloomberg news platform said, \"We have to be open-minded.\"\nIt is not known in which phases infected are infectious\nWhether people can infect other people during the incubation period, even though they have no complaints at all, could decide how the outbreak continues. The first case in Germany initially suggested that this might be the case. During a business trip, a Chinese woman is said to have infected an employee of the car supplier Webasto in Bavaria, although she has not yet noticed any symptoms, as scientists on the 30th. In January written in a report in the New England Journal of Medicine (Rothe et al., 2020). In the meantime, it has become apparent that this information was wrong. According to a report in the magazine Science, the authors had not asked the woman themselves if she had any complaints during her stay in Germany, but had first relied on statements from several Webasto employees.\nIt was only later that the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and the Bavarian National Office for Health and Food Safety contacted the woman in Shanghai and learned from her that she probably had mild symptoms after all. This was confirmed by the RKI against TIME ONLINE. Therefore, the patient had unspecific symptoms such as back pain and took a fever-reducing medicine. The RKI subsequently corrected the publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, according to its own information.\nAll this does not mean that there is no asymptomatic transmission, there is just no definite knowledge of it. Based on the data available to date, the WHO assumes that the virus is mainly spread by infected people who also have complaints. However, there is still insufficient research into the extent to which people who experience symptoms such as mild colds are already contagious.\nHere more about the new Coronavirus, its possible origin and the epidemic.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2161}, {"content": "China admits gaps in the response to the new coronavirus. After being criticised by several countries, Beijing admitted on Tuesday that it needed \"to improve the national emergency management system\" by failing to handle the outbreak of the new coronavirus in the best way. The number of deaths in China has risen to 425, according to the latest report released by the Chinese health authorities this Tuesday.\nAfter a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, the most powerful body in Chinese policy, chaired by Xi Jinping, Beijing admitted that improvements were needed after the \"gaps and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic\", cites the Xinhua State News Agency. \"We need to improve our emergency management system and improve our capabilities to carry out urgent and dangerous tasks.\"\n\"We need to increase market surveillance and ban and punish wildlife markets,\" adds the same news, quoted by the BBC.\nAlready on Monday, the Chinese Government had admitted some deficiencies caused by the new coronavirus outbreak (known as 2019-nCoV): medical equipment, surgical masks, protective suits and goggles were lacking.\nAlthough Chinese factories are able to produce 20 million protective masks per day, they are only operating at 60%70% of their capacity due to the Chinese New Year's holiday, and are unable to respond to demand, especially after several provinces have decreed in recent weeks, the compulsory use of masks.\n\"We are not currently pandemic\" explains Sylvie Briand, director of the global preparedness department for the infectious risks of the World Health Organisation, in statements to the media present. The term applies to a situation of global spread of a disease, which, for the time being, is ruled out by the WHO.\nThe death toll is up again this Tuesday. Of the 425 deaths since the end of December in China, 414 occurred in Hubei Province, where a record of deaths occurred on a single day on Tuesday: 64.\nHong Kong recorded the first death by coronavirus. The victim was a 39-year-old man who already had health problems. According to the authorities of the territory, the man travelled by train to Wuhan, the center of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on January 21, and returned to Hong Kong on January 23. Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK indicated that last week the man had muscle aches and fever. Later, \"it was transferred to an isolation wing after confirmation of the coronavirus\". Counting on this death and that of a Philippine citizen on Sunday, the overall number of deaths rises to 427.\nThe number of infected has also increased. More than twenty thousand infected in China alone. Overall, 151 cases were detected in 23 countries and regions, including Belgium, the last country to register a positive case of coronavirus. This is a woman, without symptoms, who was part of the group of nine Belgians who were repatriated, Le Soir said.\nThe virus has killed more in China than the SARS epidemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome). However, the mortality rate is lower: in the case of the new coronavirus it is 2,1% according to the Chinese National Health Commission. In Hubei, epicentre of the outbreak, the rate is slightly higher: 3,1%. It was in this province that around 97% of all deaths occurred. In the case of SARS, it was 10%.\nBy comparison, seasonal influenza usually has a lower mortality rate than 1% and should cause about 400 thousand deaths around the world per year, according to data presented by The Guardian.\nOf the more than 400 confirmed coronavirus deaths in China, 80% of the victims were over 60 years old and 75% had other diseases than coronavirus. Two thirds of the victims were male, adds Jiao Yahui, deputy director of the state health administration, cited by CNN.\nOn average, a patient needs nine days to fully recover. In Hubei, as there are more cases and fewer means to treat them, recovery time is higher: 20 days. According to the data from Johns Hopkins University in the US, which has been updating the numbers for this virus, 684 people recovered after being diagnosed with the new coronavirus. The Chinese National Health Commission states that it is possible to recover from less severe symptoms in just one week\nThe cases\nMore serious cases have appeared in older patients. Records show that the younger patient is only one month old and is in stable condition. There are other children infected with the new coronavirus, most of them in stable condition, writes the SCMP. In spite of this, health officials have advised pregnant women and children to take more intensive protection measures.\nThis Tuesday, the Japanese authorities are testing the 3700 passengers and crew members of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who are prevented from leaving the vessel a day ago.\nThe ship is serving as a quarantine site in Yokohama harbor about an hour from Tokyo. The alert was issued after a passenger traveling on the vessel in January had a positive result in a coronavirus test.\nAccording to Reuters, passengers are waiting in their rooms and according to the social media feed, not many are trying to get out. Everyone will be subjected to a medical test and anyone with fever or feeling unwell will be tested. It's only after that that that the authorities will decide who to let off the ship.\nSeveral countries are closing borders or banning the arrival of travellers who have been to China. This is the case in Taiwan, which will begin to prohibit the arrival of foreigners who have trod Chinese territory in the last 14 days from this Friday. This ban does not apply to citizens living in Hong Kong or Macao, the Foreign Minister of Taiwan, quoted on Tuesday by the South China Morning Post, said.\nHong Kong declared the borders closed last Monday and Macao can follow in its footsteps. The chief executive of Macao has admitted that the territory is considering closing its borders with China, but for now only the temporary closure of casinos is decided for two weeks, following two more confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, one of which is an employee of a casino. Macao now records ten confirmed cases.\nHo Iat Seng also pointed out that closing the borders is a difficult decision because it has to assess the impact on food supply to the territory and the daily routine of many residents of Macao and many workers of the territory living in China. The person responsible also appealed to the public not to leave the house and \"reduce to the maximum the commercial activities\", writes Lusa agency.\nThe Portuguese Consulate General in Macao and Hong Kong advised the Portuguese community to follow the guidance of the authorities of the territory, within the framework of preventive measures against the new Chinese coronavirus.\nThe Health Ministers of the G7 countries (consisting of the USA, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Italy) had a telephone meeting on Monday and decided that they will jointly coordinate the regulations to be applied to travellers, research and cooperation with the World Health Organisation (WHO). The U.S. had already closed its borders to travelers who had been to China and ordered the diplomatic corps to leave the country. Beijing accused Washington of promoting and encouraging panic by making this decision, which goes against WHO recommendations.\nSeveral nations, such as Portugal, removed nationals from affected areas in China, placing them in quarantine on arrival. On Tuesday, the Malaysian and Thailand authorities removed dozens of citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, currently under quarantine.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThe virus is a form of coronavirus that has not yet been observed in humans. The most common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulties. In more serious cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, renal failure or even death, according to WHO.\nAccording to a study published in the scientific journal The Lancet, which analyses at least 99 cases of the new coronavirus treated at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan between 1 and 20 in January, at least 46 people had been in the Wuhan fish market. The average age of the infected is 55,5 years and most of them were male. The most common symptoms are fever and cough. At least 11 of the infected in this hospital died from organ failure. Researchers concluded that the infection affects older men more with other pre-existing medical problems\nres.\u00a0\n", "label": 1, "id": 2162}, {"content": "What if a malaria medicine was the key to beating Covid-19? Efforts to find a cure, or at least an effective medicine against the effects of the new coronavirus, multiply as the pandemic grows. In addition to a vaccine race (China, Germany, the United States), hopes are now turned to a medicine that is 70-year-old: chlorokine, used to prevent and treat certain types of malaria. With one advantage: it is a cheap and relatively simple medicine to produce. Approved in Portugal by Infarmed, \"Chloroquine is an antiparasitic agent belonging to the group of antimalarial medicines\". And where does the hope come from that it will work? From converging news arriving from various geographies.\nIn Marseille, south of France, a group of doctors said they had shown good results in the use of the medicine in patients with Covid-19. In a test involving 36 of these patients, chloroquine was administered to 20 and between these, 70% had negative analysis of the new coronavirus after six days. This percentage of the cured is well above that of the group that did not take the medicine, only 12.5% have recovered.\nThe fact that chloroquine is being tested should not surprise, says Andrew Preston, a microbiology specialist, the British \"The Telegraph\". The antiviral effects of the medicine had already had an effect on the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which started in Asia in 2003. Chloroquine \"received relatively little attention when the SARS outbreak died. Recognizing that the current virus is a close relative, several researchers are testing whether chloroquine can be a therapy for the current pandemic\", said the same expert. And although the Marseilles test does not serve as proof of effectiveness, even because it was done with a small number of patients, the news comes along with others in the same direction.\nIn Wuhan, a Chinese city where the pandemic began, a laboratory study by the Institute of Virology, placed chlorine as \"highly effective\" in the control of infection by Covid-19. In the United States, at the University of Minnesota, a group of unwell volunteers, but who have been in contact with infected patients, will be exposed to the active substance to see if Covid-19 advances. Similar tests have also been conducted in Australia. And the World Health Organization itself included the medicine as one of the priorities of the Solidarity Trial project, a study, and an international effort to find an effective remedy.\nDepending on Biopharma, anti-malaria may even be the solution. The group of multinational companies had reported a number of development and research projects to combat the crisis caused by Covid, and Bayer Pharmaceuticals took a step forward, announcing the donation of three million chlorine tablets to the U.S. to further the testing.\nThere is also no shortage of voices in favour of this solution. Earlier this week, Tesla's multimillionaire Elon Musk, CEO, drew attention on Twitter to a study by three U.S. researchers, James Todaro, from Columbia University, Gregory Rigano, Johns Hopkins, and Thomas Broker of Stanford, in which chlorokine is \"an effective treatment for coronavirus\".\nMusk added that another article in the same sense \"hit right\" with much of what he has heard say to \"intelligent people\". Although what is heard is not recognised as scientific fact, Musk recalled his experience with the medicine, which saved him from \"certain death\" when he contracted malaria. \"Chloroquine may be worth considering,\" he wrote.\nAlso James Todaro, one of the researchers in the study cited by Musk, has been using Twitter to welcome advances in research. And with the support she'll get. This Thursday, US President Donald Trump asked the Federal Medicines Agency (Food and Drug Administration) for speedy approval of medicines to treat patients at Covid-19. And one of them is precisely the hydroxychloroquine (similar to chloroquine), which, Trump says, \"will not kill anyone\", is \"very powerful\" and has had \"very encouraging previous results\".\n", "label": 1, "id": 2163}, {"content": "China expels American journalists as spat with U.S. escalates.

It is closed on Jan 1, 2020. \n On Jan 9, the WHO says that the outbreak in Wuhan was caused by a previously unknown type of coronavirus, which is a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like Sars. \n To date, 59 people have been infected, of whom seven are in a serious condition, according to an official toll. \n The Chinese health authorities say a first person died of the virus on Jan 11. They revise downwards the number of sick people to 41. \n On Jan 13, the virus spreads beyond China's borders for the first time, with a case emerging in Thailand, according to the WHO. The victim is a Chinese woman diagnosed with mild pneumonia who was returning from a trip to Wuhan. \n On Jan 15, China's health commission says no human-to-human transmission of the virus behind the Wuhan outbreak has been confirmed so far, but the possibility \"cannot be excluded\". \n The next day,\u00a0a first case of the virus is confirmed in Japan in someone who had stayed in Wuhan in early January. \n On Jan 17, a second person, a 69-year-old man, dies in Wuhan, according to the authorities. \n The same day, the CDC announces that it will begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan at three airports: San Francisco, New York's JFK and Los Angeles. \n On Jan 20, a third death and more than 100 new cases are announced in China, sparking concerns ahead of the annual Chinese New Year holiday which begins on Jan 25 and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel nationwide. \n The virus is present in Beijing in the north, Shanghai in the east and Shenzhen in the south.

SINGAPORE \u2014 South Korea reported 334 new cases of the Covid-19 disease on Thursday (Feb 27) morning, the largest jump in the number of newly diagnosed patients in the country since its first was confirmed on Jan 20.\u00a0 \n Hours later on Thursday afternoon, another 171 cases were reported, raising the total tally to 1,766, the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC) said. \n Up until Feb 19 last week, the number of confirmed cases hovered below 100, but it skyrocketed from Feb 20 onwards to where it is now. \n Coming under the spotlight and linked closely to the outbreak in South Korea is the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony \u2014 a secretive sect that claims to be Christian and is based in Daegu city where around 64 per cent of the country\u2019s infections have sprung.\u00a0 \n How did the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory symptoms such as pneumonia get out of control so quickly in South Korea, claiming 13 lives so far in the country?\u00a0\u00a0 \n CHURCH OF \u2018NEW HEAVEN AND EARTH\u2019 \n At present, the bulk of the cases are from Daegu city, which is home to some 2.4 million residents \u2014 of which 1,132 have been sickened by the virus as of Thursday afternoon. \n The city, located in the North Gyeongsang province, is also the base of operations for the Shincheonji church. Shincheonji means \"new heaven and earth\" in Korean. \n American news channel CNN reported on Thursday that the South Korean authorities believe a large number of cases in the country attended a service at Shincheonji church or have been in contact with attendees. \n British newspaper The Guardian reported that more than six in 10 of the people infected are linked to the church.\u00a0 \n PATIENT 31 AND HER MOVEMENTS \n The Shincheonji cluster began with Patient 31, a 61-year-old woman who developed a fever on Feb 10 and went to at least four services in Daegu before being diagnosed, news agency AFP reported. \n Several media reports said that the woman did not get herself tested for the coronavirus because she had not travelled overseas and simply thought that she had caught the common cold. \n During the course of two weekends, she came into contact with more than 1,000 churchgoers. \n Detailing the chronology of events involving Patient 31, Bloomberg reported that she first checked into the Saeronan Chinese Medicine Hospital on Feb 7 due to headaches after being involved in a car accident the day before. \n The hospital said that at the time, she did not have any fever, cough or respiratory symptoms. \n On her third day in the hospital, she developed a fever and went for a flu test, which came back negative. \n KCDC said that she left the hospital on Feb 10 for two hours to attend a morning service at Shincheonji church. \n South Korea\u2019s health authorities also said that she had lunch with a friend at a hotel in eastern Daegu on Feb 15 and attended another worship service at Shincheonji on Feb 16. \n It is common in South Korea for hospital patients to come and go, and they have even been seen venturing out while wearing hospital garb and wheeling intravenous drips alongside them, Bloomberg reported. \n On Feb 17, Patient 31 was finally confirmed to have Covid-19. That day, her condition worsened and a scan showed she had signs of pneumonia. This prompted the doctors to test her for the coronavirus. \n ILLNESS \u2018NOT VALID REASON\u2019 FOR MISSING SERVICE \n A former member of the Shincheonji church told CNN that illness was \u201cnever accepted as a valid reason to miss services\u201d. \n Attendance was monitored through a roll call, and churchgoers would have to use a special card to swipe in and out of the venue. \n The number of confirmed cases started multiplying exponentially shortly after Patient 31 was diagnosed and shot past 1,000 by Wednesday, which prompted the government to raise its health alert to the highest level. \n Health officials in South Korea still do not know how she was infected and how she spread the virus to fellow Shincheonji members. \n Professor Kim Chang-yup, who researches on health policy at Seoul National University, told Bloomberg that what made the case worse was that Patient 31 spent a considerable amount of time in a crowded areas. \n Followers in the sect would sit on the floor \"packed together like sardines\u201d during services that last hours, CNN reported. \n Various media reports have pointed to the church\u2019s connectio\nn to the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in China. \n Shincheonji members held meetings in Wuhan until December, stopping only when they realised that their community in South Korea had been hit by Covid-19, Hong Kong daily South China Morning Post reported. \n A FUNERAL AND A HOSPITAL\u00a0 \n The South Korean authorities are also trying to determine whether Patient 31 is connected to an outbreak at another hospital outside Daegu, where a funeral for the brother of the sect\u2019s leader was held earlier this month. \n AFP reported that between Jan 31 and Feb 2, an unknown number of members came together for the funeral, which was said to have been held at Cheongdo Daenam Hospital. \n The hospital is the second hot spot for the virus within South Korea, with at least 114 cases. More than half of the fatalities in the country are linked to the hospital. \n Shincheonji members are known for proselytising in secret and not revealing their identities, which makes it hard for people to know if they have been in contact with a member, AFP reported. \n However, mounting public anger has forced the church to hand over a list of 212,000 members to the authorities to enable them to be checked for Covid-19 symptoms. \n Previously, the church had boasted that it had more than 240,000 members, raising doubts over the accuracy of the roster. \n Despite the\u00a0large number of cases in Daegu city and Cheongdo county, the South Korean government has yet to forcibly control the movement of people from these areas or ban visitors from China, the New York Times reported. \n From Wednesday, Singapore has imposed restrictions on new visitors who have travelled to Cheongdo county or Daegu city in the past 14 days. \n This means that travellers\u00a0from the two places will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore.\u00a0\n", "label": 1, "id": 2169}, {"content": "U.S. warns citizens in China about pneumonia outbreak.

PARIS (AFP) - Members of China's Uighur minority living in exile are sounding the alarm over the risk of the coronavirus spreading in camps inside the country, where non-governmental organisations\u00a0say hundreds of thousands of people have been rounded up by Beijing. \n So far, official figures released by Chinese state media give no major cause for concern over the outbreak of the disease , known as\u00a0Covid-19,\u00a0in the north-eastern region of Xinjiang that is home to the Uighurs, a Muslim minority who speak a Turkic language. \n It is far from the epicentre of the outbreak and just 55 cases have been reported in the region so far. The first patients to fully recover in the region have already left hospital, according to official media. \n Over 1,100 people have died in China due to the coronavirus epidemic although most of the deaths and infections have been in the central Hubei province, whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicentre of the outbreak. \n But representatives of the Uighur diaspora warn there is real reason to fear a rapid spread of coronavirus in the controversial Chinese camps. \n The virus spreads from person to person through droplets disseminated by sneezing or coughing, and confining large groups of people together, possibly without adequate access to germ-killing soap and water, will increase the likelihood of an outbreak. \n China has rounded up an estimated one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic minorities in internment camps, NGOs and experts say, and little is known about the conditions inside them. \n Beijing insists the camps are \"vocational training centres\" necessary to combat terrorism. \n \"People are starting to panic. Our families are there, dealing with the camps and the virus, and we do not know if they have enough to eat or if they have masks,\" said Dilnur Reyhan, a French sociologist of Uighur origin. \n A petition posted on Change.org signed by over 3,000 people urges the closure of the camps to reduce the threat. \n There have also been social media hashtag campaigns such as #VirusThreatInThecamps and #WHO2Urumqi to urge the World Health Organisation (WHO) to send a delegation to the city of Xinjiang. \n \"We must not wait until news of hundreds of coronavirus-related deaths in the camps before we react,\" the petition says. \n \"As China continues to struggle to contain the virus in Wuhan, we can easily assume the virus will rapidly spread throughout the camps and affect millions if we don't raise the alarm now.\" \n Regional authorities in Xinjiang did not respond to a query from AFP about measures taken to prevent the spread of the virus in the camps. \n The World Uyghur Congress (WUC), one of several groups representing Uighurs outside China, said it was very concerned \"that if measures are not taken to further limit the spread of this virus, it could rapidly infect large numbers of people\" in Xinjiang. \n \"These people are in a vulnerable and weakened state due to the Chinese government's abuses and mistreatment,\" said its president Dolkun Isa. \n \"This has just further compounded the suffering of the Uighur people, as our friends and family are now in even greater danger.\" \n French immunologist Norbert Gualde said it was impossible to say precisely under what conditions the Uighurs and other detainees are living in Chinese camps. \n \"There are good reasons to think that their detention is synonymous with imposed proximity, stress and fear - all circumstances that favour the transmission of a virus between those obliged to remain incarcerated,\" he said.\n", "label": 0, "id": 2173}, {"content": "Covid-19!

With this, the overall number of COVID-19 cases in India touched 50. Of these 50 cases, three have been cured and discharged while the remaining are active cases.\nFour of the six COVID-19 cases that were reported on March 10 were detected in Bengaluru, and two in Pune. All these patients had a travel history to the US or Dubai--two locations where coronavirus cases have been on a rise.\nThe 50th COVID-19 case in India was reported 41 days after the first case was reported in Kerala on January 30. The first patient was a student studying at a university in Wuhan, China (the epicentre of the global coronavirus outbreak) and was spending her vacation at her home in Thrissur district.\nIn a span of four days, two more people tested positive for COVID-19 in Kerala.

Analysing statements issued by the Union Health Ministry, we found that 39 of the first 50 COVID-19 cases in India had a foreign travel history, while 11 cases contracted the infection through local transmission i.e. in India.\nMost of the cases (23) had a travel history to Italy. This included the 16 Italian nationals who tested positive in Jaipur.\nBesides this, four COVID-19 cases had a travel history to Iran and an equal number to the US; three cases had a travel history to China and an equal number to Dubai; one patient had travelled to Oman and one to Thailand and Singapore.\nMeanwhile, the 11 cases that contracted the viral infection in India included:\nThis situation demands caution.\nOf the 11 cases of local transmission, 10 were where the patients came in contact with somebody who had travelled abroad. In other words, these patients are the ones who fell ill without having visited any coronavirus-hit country.\nIt will be important to see if such cases continue to get reported in the coming weeks.\nTimeline of 1st 50 cases\nBesides them, an Indian driver who was hired by the group also tests positive for COVID-19.\nSix COVID-19 cases were also reported in Agra. All of them were people who had been exposed to the Delhi patient detected on March 2.\nOf the five cases, the patient in Delhi did not have any travel history outside India. Health officials said she contracted the viral infection from the techie who tested positive in Gurgaon on March 5.\nThe three-year-old girl in Ernakulam and the patient in Punjab had a travel history to Italy; the patient in Jammu (a 63-year-old woman) had a travel history to Iran.\nThe two patients in Pune had a travel history to Dubai.\nPrecautions you can take\nAs per WHO, you should observe the following precautions:\n", "label": 1, "id": 2178}, {"content": "COVID-19.

A new coronavirus with epicenter in Wuhan, China, has been frightening the world. You've killed over a hundred people and infected thousands of them. How can genetics be used to oversee viruses like this and watch how they spread? In an article published this Wednesday in the mSphere scientific journal of the American Society for Microbiology, a team of scientists describes an improvement in the new generation genetic sequencing to monitor coronavirus, especially those from bats.\nCoronavirus are a large family of viruses that live in animals such as birds or bats. They can be transmitted from animals to people, but most of the coronavirus strains only circulate between animals and do not even infect humans. If they reach humans, they can cause respiratory diseases, from a cold to more serious situations such a s severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\nTo monitor how coronavirus spreads and evolves in animals, new generation sequencing (NGS) has been used. However, this sequenc e can be very expensive and many genetic markers of viruses can be lost.\nA team led by Lin-Fa Wang (from Duke University Medical School and Singapore National University) decided to make NGS cheaper and more effective. To this end, it perfected one of the strategies of NGS with molecular probes: DNA or radioactive RNA sequences used to detect the presence of a complementary sequence in a sample.\nIn the experiments, we were able to identify coronavirus, increase the sensitivity of the process and decrease its cost, as stated in a communication about work. \"It does not mean that this improvement is a panacea for all NGS challenges, but in this case it is a step in the right direction,\" Lin-Fa Wang considers.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThe investigator adds that this approach will be important to monitor coronavirus in bats. \"Coronavirus, especially bats, is an important source of emerging infectious diseases,\" says Lin-Fa Wang, who has the nickname Batman. For example, the coronavirus that caused the SARS outbreak in 2003 is very close genetically to what is found in bats.\nAlthough it is not yet known the origin of the new coronavirus whose epidemic began in Wuhan, bats are one of the likely sources. These animals may also be a reservoir of the Ebola or Nipah virus. In a scientific article published in 2018 in Cell Host and Microbe magazine, it is suggested that bats will be able to host many viruses due to the evolutionary adaptations they had to make to fly, which ultimately changed their immune system.\nAnd how can the new approach contribute to combating an epidemic? When there are no outbreaks, scientists can update the genetic probing banks related to coronavirus. During outbreaks, this information can be used to monitor the evolution of the virus and its transmission in animals and people.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2181}, {"content": "i 'saw' doctor without leaving my house and got medicine delivered to my doorstep. With the threat of Covid-19 hanging in the air, especially potentially literally in the air in medical clinics (and the door handles, waiting chairs and counters of clinics, too), let's just say going to see the doctor is one of the last things people want to be doing right now. Enter telemedicine services. There are a handful of clinics offering consultations online, from the comfort of your home, and you don't even have to really see a doctor. The doc may 'see' you, though (we'll explain more later). They'll deliver your medicine to you and even give you an MC. The main condition, though, is that your illness can't be serious, at least according to rxemedium.io, which is the MOH-registered clinic with telemedicine service 8days.sg visited. Any body temperature of 38 degree celsius and above will garner you a warning that they are unable to serve you, and to please visit a clinic to get examined. We think this is fair. We wouldn't want any more severe illness to be treated online either. But for common sicknesses like fever, coughs and sore throats, telemedicine is definitely a viable option, whether or not we're in the grip of a deadly coronavirus. So here's the homepage of telemedicine provider Rxemedium, which is helmed by Dr. Dana Elliott Srither, a doctor with 20 years of clinical experience.   This is not an ad! It's the homepage of Rxemedium, which provides telemedicine services.  What we did next was register our name, mobile number, address and IC. The latter is done by taking a pic of your IC and attaching it to the form. So far, so legit. Next comes the 'consultation'. But first, a warning page that if you're experiencing respiratory symptoms or have within 14 days been to Hubei or come into contact with anyone with Covid-19 or recent travellers from mainland China, to see a doctor at a clinic instead.Otherwise, you move on to the next page, which allows you to order medicine and choose from one of four ailments: Cough, Fever/General Pain, Sore Throat or Stuffy/Runny Nose. These are the only four illnesses that are currently treatable on Rxemedium, and the service is only for adults. Dr. Elliott tells us they are working on telemedicine services for kids.  Got a minor ailment? No need to see a doctor at the clinic. Get your meds delivered to you with telemedicine services.  So after picking your ailment on the website, you have to state whether you have experienced the symptoms for more than three days. Three or more days of these symptoms, and again you get the warning to go to a clinic instead. If it's less than three days, you get to the next page, where you have to input your body temperature. This is, of course, only possible if you have a thermometer with you. If your temperature is too high (38 degree celsius and above), you won't be served further. Of course, you can lie and input anything for any of the questions, but what would be the point of that? We'd want to get proper treatment if we were really ill.On the next page, they'll then ask if you're allergic to certain medications that are relevant to your ailment. If no, you'll be asked next if you require an MC. You can get an MC for up to two days. Next, you'll need to upload a photo of yourself with your ID. This requires you to take a new photo of yourself holding some form of identification. Finally, a summary and payment page. Then, submit and wait for your medication to arrive. If you order before 11am, you get your meds within the day, before 6pm. Otherwise, you have to wait till the next day. The clinic is working to add more same-day delivery slots in the near future. The services plus medication appears to cost a flat rate of $28. That's comparable to a standard clinic visit, but you get your meds delivered. Not bad. But if you have a more unusual ailment, like a rash or a red eye, too bad lah, have to go to a clinic.   These common ailments are the only four being treated on Rxemedium.io. Anything more serious or unusual, please see a doctor at your nearest clinic.    Is it very painful when swallowing water? The telemedicine consultation is somewhat like a doctor's consultation, without the face-to-face interaction.  Our meds arrived at our doorstep by courier at about 4pm, about five hours after we had our consultation. In the package was a pleasant surprise, a surgical mask! There was also a receipt and an MC for two days, which we requested for.  P\nrecious commodity: A surgical mask is worth its weight in gold these days, and Rxemedium gave one out free with our medication, which was couriered within five hours of our tele-consultation.    Another precious commodity, a Medical Certificate. Although slightly less these days with so many people working from home.  When we ask Dr Elliot, who also has a physical MOH-registered clinic located in Balestier, if people might abuse how easy it is to get an MC via telemedicine, he says, As physicians, we have to give all our patients the benefit of the doubt, that their conditions are genuine. For example, if a patient says that she is contemplating suicide or thinking of cutting herself, we have to take her seriously. If we feel that they are malingering, then we as physicians will go down a slippery slope. As a parting shot, we then received a message from the doctor himself via our Rxemedium account, saying: Dear Celine, We hope you are feeling better. If you have other preferred medicines, please upload your old medicine labels to us for pre-approval before your next visit. We will follow up with you over a total of 7 days. Should you have any change in your condition, please contact us here. Please use the face mask when going out and stay safe. Rgds, Dr Dana. How nice! We checked in with the doc, who told us that the messaging feature on the account is for patients to update them should their condition change for the worse, and that they can still reach Rxemedium for advice, as long as it's within a seven-day period.Try telemedicine at Rxemedium at https://www.rxemedium.io/. \n This is not an ad!

Chinese authorities confirmed they had identified a new virus a week later.\nThe new virus, identified by scientists as 2019-nCoV, is a coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the common cold and more serious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\nCoronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.\nIt is unclear how deadly the new virus is. Although severe cases can cause pneumonia and death, there may be many cases of milder disease going undetected. Many of those who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems.\nThe new coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person, although it is not clear how easily that happens. Most cases so far are in people who have been in Wuhan, family members of those infected, or medical workers.\nTransmission is most likely through close contact with an infected person via particles in the air from coughing or sneezing, or by someone touching an infected person or object with the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes.\nIn order to reduce the likelihood of transmission, the WHO recommends that people frequently wash their hands, cover their mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says those who develop symptoms such as coughing and fever who have been in China in the last 14 days should call ahead to a healthcare professional to establish if they need to be tested.\nAll but around 70 of the more than 6,000 cases so far identified have been in China, mostly in and around Wuhan. The other countries with confirmed cases include Australia, Cambodia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, the UAE, the United States, and Vietnam.\nThe WHO is looking very closely at cases of person-to-person transmission outside of Wuhan, which would suggest that it may have the potential to spread further.\nThe Chinese government has put Wuhan into virtual quarantine to try and stop the spread of the virus. A number of foreign governments have advised against non-essential travel to China and have begun flying their citizens out of Wuhan.\nThe new virus is a strain of coronavirus, like SARS, which killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.\nUnlike SARS, which also originated in China, it is believed the new virus can spread during the incubation period of one to 14 days, possibly before an infected person is showing symptoms.\nSo far, the new virus does not appear to be as deadly as SARS, but there have been more cases overall.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2188}, {"content": "New Coronavirus Vaccine May Be Faster To Develop. By Sakina MohamedKUALA LUMPUR\u00a0(Bernama) -- With the number of cases and deaths already surpassing that of SARS, teams around the world are racing to come up with a vaccine against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov).At the time of writing, the virus has infected 43,104 people and killed 1,018 others.Developing a vaccine safe\u00a0for human use typically takes years, but there is reason to believe that the process will be speedier this time around, said academician and virologist Emeritus Prof Datuk Dr Lam Sai Kit.\u201cAdvances in technology now makes it possible to come up with candidate vaccines in a matter of weeks, unlike traditional methods which can take years,\u201d he told Bernama when contacted.In addition to that, scientists in China sequenced the virus\u2019s genome and made it available on Jan 10, just a month after the Dec 8 report of the first case of pneumonia from an unknown virus in Wuhan.In contrast, scientists took more than half a year to sequence the coronavirus after the SARS outbreak began in late 2002. \u00a0\u00a0HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?Lam noted that although candidate vaccines may be available in a matter of weeks, it would take much longer for them to be evaluated for human use.\u201cThese candidate vaccines have to be tested in animal studies before human clinical trials can be started. It is still a long road ahead, and by the time a vaccine is ready, the outbreak may already be over \u2013 like in the case of SARS, where it took 20 months before a candidate vaccine was developed,\u201d said Lam.The vaccine never made it to the market because the virus was successfully contained with public health measures. The vaccine against MERS, meanwhile, is still being developed.Immunologist Datuk Dr Musa Nordin said despite the pressure to come up with a vaccine as soon as possible, it must be noted that vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.\u201cOn average, it takes 10 years from pre-clinical trials through Phase 1-3 clinical trials before it is proven efficacious and safe for registration by regulatory bodies and use in man.\u201cHowever, the new coronavirus has the benefit of experience with previous candidate vaccines for MERS and SARS, allowing a jump start on the development of vaccines. If I had to hazard a best optimistic guess, I would say (a vaccine would be developed) within six months,\u201d he said to Bernama.\u00a0WHAT IF IT MUTATES?One of the fears is that the 2019-nCov would mutate after a vaccine is finally developed, affecting its efficacy.However, it should be noted that coronavirus do not undergo the same type of genome shuffling as the influenza virus, which is constantly mutating.Like SARS, the genome of the novel coronavirus comprises a single strand of RNA (ribonucleic acid). Microbes with such genome are known to mutate very quickly, but SARS has a molecular proofreading system that reduces its mutation rate.Given the similarity to SARS at the genomic level, it has been suggested that the 2019-nCov would not be as prone to mutation as the flu virus, which comprise multiple single-stranded RNA segments.Therefore, if a vaccine is produced, it would still be effective.Lam said that mutation is always a possibility with RNA viruses like the coronavirus.\u201cUsually, a major change happens when the virus jumps species. Hopefully, if there is a mutation, it will be a minor and not involving the spike protein, which is\u00a0the important antigen used to produce the neutralising antibody in our immune system.\u201cWith minor changes, the vaccine will still offer protection, or modify the severity of the disease,\u201d he said.\u00a0CEPIThe Coalition of Endemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in January announced that it would be funding three programmes to develop vaccines against the 2019-nCov.It has engaged, among others, the Queensland University to work on a vaccine using its recently developed rapid response technology.The university\u2019s head of School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences Prof Paul Young said that they would be using the novel technology, known as the molecular clamp, for the rapid generation of the vaccine.Young\u2019s team of researchers have already experienced using this novel technology to produce candidate vaccines against influenza, Nipah, Ebola, and MERS. The team is optimistic that it will be able to develop the coronavirus vaccine within six months.\u201cWe are working around the clock to produce enough of the spike proteins in cells to produce this sub-unit vaccine,\u201d said Young\nin an email.A sub-unit vaccine is a fragment of a pathogen, typically a surface protein that is used to trigger an immune response. This is turn will stimulate acquired immunity against the pathogen from which it is derived.CEPI is a nonprofit organisation formed in 2017 to fund vaccine development for emerging infectious diseases. It is based in Oslo, Norway and is a global partnership created to spearhead development of vaccines in this type of emergency.CEPI is also funding Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc to develop the coronavirus vaccine.\u00a0\u201cBased on our experience of using new technologies to produce MERS and Lassa fever vaccines, Inovio was able to design and construct a potential vaccine in a matter of hours following the release of the new coronavirus genetic code by China. We are targeting the first human tests to begin in the US before early summer,\u201d Joseph Kim, the President and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals was quoted as saying.Another CEPI-funded vaccine project is with Moderna Therapeutics Inc, which is working with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Moderna is working on a vaccine based on RNA molecules that instruct cells to make proteins to prevent or fight diseases.\u00a0GOOD HYGIENE HABITS STILL BEST BETLam said there was no guarantee that any antiviral drugs or vaccines would become available by the end of the current outbreak despite all the research being done. However, there was still reason to be optimistic.\u201cAlthough antiviral drugs and effective vaccines are still some months away, it must be remembered that we can still stop the virus in its track. As shown with SARS and MERS, public health approaches must remain a priority in containing the spread of the disease and treating those who have become infected.\u201cContact tracing, isolating infected patients, wearing of face masks, frequent washing of hands, avoiding close contact with infected people are well tried and proven public health methods to control outbreaks. Now that news is coming out of China that the virus can be spread by aerosol in addition to droplets, it will be a bit more challenging to avoid infection. A vaccine will be most welcome.\u201d\u00a0-- BERNAMA\n", "label": 1, "id": 2189}, {"content": "The one under the radar. How's it going with the curve? Will flattenthecurve work, will it succeed in slowing down the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 Coronavirus in Germany and the world, now that people are staying at home, imposing curfew on governments and minimising social contacts? This is difficult to predict, not least because there are a very high number of unknown infections. No one knows exactly how tall it is.\nAt the same time, it is precisely this dark figure that will determine the course of the pandemic in the coming days and weeks. The researchers around Ruiyun Li from Imperial College in London also conclude from an analysis of the outbreak situation in China, which they published in the Science Journal (Li et al., 2020).\nUsing figures from 375 cities in China, the international research group modelled in retrospect how the virus occurred in the period between the 10th. and the 23rd. January 2020, that is, at the very beginning of the outbreak, spread. According to the model, more than 80-percent of all infectious cases may have remained unknown.\nAlthough an unidentified person was on average only half as infectious as a person whose infection was documented, the non-statistically recorded infected could have been responsible for 86% of all diseases across China. Many of those infected with the Sars CoV-2 virus are experiencing mild or no symptoms at all. So they themselves do not notice the infection and do not notice others as sick. These people also tend to continue to participate in social life. In this way, it is precisely these uninfected people who are exposed to the virus that can expose much more healthy people than people who are clearly ill and are therefore more likely to be identified as such or treated in a hospital anyway.\nAnd the experts calculated with the same method, which had caused the limitations of social contacts in China. They investigated how the virus spread after the Chinese government had taken anti-infective measures. This includes, in particular, the fact that the authorities restricted or banned travel to and from Wuhan, ordered or at least suggested domestic quarantine and expanded the capacity for rapid testing procedures.\nThese restrictions would have helped prevent the virus from spreading as quickly as it did at the beginning. Among other things, the infection rate of unknown patients was reduced. The reason could be that the authorities were able to better understand infection chains or people who had identified themselves but were not documented as such had less contact with other people due to the general curfew.\nAt the end of 2019, China reported to the World Health Organisation, WHO, the incidence of pneumonia of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-nCov. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. It is now known as Sars-CoV-2 (CoV stands for Coronavirus, Sars for respiratory disease caused by a similar pathogen).\nSars-CoV-2 may have spread from a food market in Wuhan. It also sold exotic animals such as reptiles. The lung disease that the new virus can cause is now called Covid-19 (English for Coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is called zoonosis, a disease caused by an animal pathogen. Parts of the viral effluent of Sars-CoV-2 are the same pathogens that infect bats. The new virus may have been transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediary.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of 2019 about 2.500, and every third party has died from it.\nOverall, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause colds.\nMedical practitioners assume that the V\nthe virus is transmitted from person to person mainly via droplet infection.\nThe WHO recommends general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nMore than 200.000 cases of Corona worldwide (stand 18th March) have now been registered. In addition, there is a high dark number, which researchers roughly suspect somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have died as a result of this worldwide. In most cases, however, the infection is very mild. Among the victims of death are, in particular, people with serious illnesses and elderly people.\nFollow the progress of registered cases in Germany on this map.\nThe number of infected worldwide tested positive for Corona shows this map from Johns Hopkins University.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The WHO shared on 28th. In January, approximately one fifth of those reported as infected become seriously ill by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. Meanwhile, the WHO is treating the disease as a pandemic. Various states have imposed entry and exit restrictions to slow down the spread.\nTypical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Countries around the world have reported cases of infection, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccinations. Initial clinical studies with vaccines have begun, i. e. few patients are given a test vaccination.\nIn order to control the virus called Sars-CoV-2, more infectious cases would have to be identified and more potential patients isolated, the authors write in the report. However, it is not clear whether these measures would be sufficient to ensure that the virus disappears in the long term and does not reappear when restrictions are relaxed.\nWhether these findings can also be applied to Germany remains unclear. The number of infected undetected and the general risk of infection varies depending on the measures implemented by the country concerned, the intensity with which testing capacities are available, and how well equipped the health system is for the outbreak. The president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) said at a press conference on the 17th. In March, one assumes to be able to identify about fifty percent of all infected in Germany. The other half of those who have contracted or will become infected are unlikely to show any or only mild symptoms and are therefore rarely recognised.\nFollow the current pandemic development here in the live blog.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2190}, {"content": "China poses substantial threat to Americans' health, way of life: Mike Pompeo.

That figure is higher than both China and hard-hit Italy, which accounts for a third of the 24,000 deaths worldwide. \n GRIM PREDICTIONS \n Even with lockdowns implemented around the world, researchers at Imperial College London said Thursday the global death toll could be staggering. \n Their model shows 1.86 million people could die, with nearly 470 million infected this year.\u00a0 \n Failure to act swiftly in imposing lockdowns and strict social distancing could make those numbers far higher, they warned. \n \"Our analysis highlights the challenging decisions faced by all governments in the coming weeks and months, but demonstrates the extent to which rapid, decisive and collective action now could save millions of lives,\" the researchers said. \n As fears mount over a global recession that could even dwarf the Great Depression of the 1930s, leaders from the Group of 20 major economies\u00a0held crisis talks by video link on Thursday. \n They pledged a \"united front\" to fight the outbreak\u00a0\u2014 along with an enormous financial rescue package. \n \"The virus respects no borders,\" the leaders said in a statement. \n \"We are injecting over US$5 trillion (S$7.17 trillion) into the global economy, as part of targeted fiscal policy, economic measures, and guarantee schemes to counteract the social, economic and financial impacts of the pandemic.\" \n They also pledged \"robust\" support for developing nations, where experts fear the coronavirus could wreak havoc. \n PAINFUL CHOICES \n Medical systems in even the most developed nations are straining under the weight of new patients. \n In New York, where tens of thousands are ill, Governor Andrew Cuomo warned there were simply not enough hospital beds. \n \"Almost any scenario that is realistic will overwhelm the capacity of the current healthcare system,\" he said. \n For those fighting on the frontlines, the pressure was showing. \n \"To watch somebody in their thirties die, it's hard,\" said one respiratory therapist in the city who requested anonymity. \"You can't have visitors. They're in the room by themselves on a ventilator. It's very depressing.\" \n In Europe, medics were already having to make choices. \n \"If I've got five patients and only one bed, I have to choose who gets it,\" Dr Sara Chinchilla, a pediatrician at a hospital near Madrid, told AFP. \n \"People are dying who could be saved but there's no space in intensive care.\" \n ECONOMIC DEVASTATION \n The pandemic has already become catastrophic for the global economy. \n In the United States, the world's largest economy, the Labor Department reported that 3.3 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week\u00a0\u2014 by far the highest number ever recorded. \n Job losses have swept across sectors from food\nservices to retail to transportation, as nearly half of the country has closed non-essential businesses. \n \"It is staggering. We are only seeing the initial numbers; they will get worse, unfortunately,\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters, estimating that half a million people in the city would lose work. \n Stock markets remained volatile, with Asian bourses in the green Friday after a third straight day of rises on Wall Street, while Europe started the day down. \n Traders have taken heart from the passage through the Senate of a $2 trillion stimulus bill\u00a0\u2014 the largest in US history, which will support American businesses and provide cash payouts averaging US$3,400 for a family of four. \n The bill goes before the\u00a0House of Representatives on Friday.

GENEVA (AFP) - The UN health agency on Tuesday (Feb 11) announced that \"Covid-19\" will be the official name of the deadly virus from China, saying the disease represented a \"very grave threat\" for the world but there was a \"realistic chance\" of stopping it. \n \"We now have a name for the disease and it's Covid-19,\" World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. \n Tedros said that \"co\" stands for \"corona\", \"vi\" for \"virus\" and \"d\" for \"disease\", while \"19\" was for the year, as the outbreak was first identified on Dec 31. \n Tedros said the name had been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location, animal species or group of people in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatisation. \n WHO had earlier given the virus the temporary name of \"2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease\" and China's National Health Commission this week said it was temporarily calling it \"novel coronavirus pneumonia\" or NCP. \n Under a set of guidelines issued in 2015, WHO advises against using place names such as Ebola and Zika - where those diseases were first identified and which are now inevitably linked to them in the public mind. \n More general names such as \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\" or \"Spanish flu\" are also now avoided as they can stigmatise entire regions or ethnic groups. \n WHO also notes that using animal species in the name can create confusion, such as in 2009 when H1N1 was popularly referred to as \"swine flu\". \n This had a major impact on the pork industry even though the disease was being spread by people rather than pigs. \n People's names - usually the scientists who identified the disease - are also banned, as are \"terms that incite undue fear\" such as \"unknown\" or \"fatal\", the WHO said. \n The virus has killed more than 1,000 people, infected over 42,000 and reached some 25 countries, with the WHO declaring a global health emergency. \n Addressing scientists at the first international conference on combating the virus earlier on Tuesday, Tedros warned that the virus was a \"very grave threat\". \n \"Viruses can have more powerful consequences than any terrorist action,\" he told reporters later. \n About 400 scientists were taking part in the two-day international meeting in Geneva called to review how the virus is transmitted and possible vaccines against it. \n \"We are not defenceless,\" Tedros said, adding: \"If we invest now... we have a realistic chance of stopping this outbreak.\" \n Participants will also discuss the source of the virus, which is thought to have originated in bats and reached humans via other \"intermediary\" species such as snakes or pangolins. \n WHO sent an advance team to China this week for an international mission to examine the epidemic. \n It was unclear, however, whether the team would be able to visit Wuhan, a city in central China which has been under lockdown after the outbreak was registered in a food and live animal market in the city. \n No specific treatment or vaccine against the virus exists, and WHO has repeatedly urged countries to share data in order to further research into the disease. \n \"That is especially true in relation to sharing of samples and sequences. To defeat this outbreak, we need open and equitable sharing, according to the principles of fairness and equity,\" Tedros told the scientific conference. \n He said he hoped the scientists could agree a roadmap \"around which researchers and donors will align\". \n Several teams of experts in Australia, Britain, China, France, Germany and the United States are racing to develop a vaccine - a process that normally takes years. \n Efforts to come up with a vaccine are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people. \n Ultimately, however, scientists may end up in the same situation they were during the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) - which died out before a vaccine could be fully developed. \n A close cousin of Covid-19, Sars spread around the world and killed nearly 800.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2195}, {"content": "G7 countries are fixing a new response to the new coronavirus.

What is the difference then to \"epidemic\"? The briefing by the World Health Organisation (WHO) this Wednesday brought about a significant change: Covid-19, brought about by the new coronavirus, has been officially declared a \"pandemic\". Almost three months after it began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the virus that has now spread to the rest of the world ceases to be treated as an \"epidemic\".\nOn Twitter, and in the voice of Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director General, the WHO warns that \"pandemic is not a word to be used lightly or carelessly\". \"It is a word that, if misused, can cause irrational fear or an unjustified acceptance that the struggle has ended, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.\"\nAccording to the WHO's own definition, an epidemic is an outbreak of a disease that spreads unexpectedly at local, regional or national level. The C.D.C., an American organization of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says it happens when you give \"an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of an illness above what is normally expected\" for that area.\nBy contrast, the WHO defined the pandemic as \"the worldwide spread of a new disease\" affecting a large number of people. According to the last count, Covid-19 has already been diagnosed in more than 122 thousand people from 121 countries- there are over 66 thousand cured.\nBeing declared a pandemic is hardly a surprise. \"The threat of a pandemic is becoming more and more real\", said the same Ghebreyesus last week. The time gap between the spread of Covid-19 and the WHO statement has been explained as an attempt to halt panic on the one hand and, on the other, as it has been believed to date that the outbreak could be contained and limited to certain countries.\nFrom now on it no longer makes sense to think about containing Covid-19. It is a \"pandemic\", i.e. a \"new internationally disseminated disease\". That is why countries will no longer try to stop new infected people from entering and will have to worry about the way in which the disease is transmitted among their citizens.\nWhen there is an epidemic in one country, others can close down and send aid to the affected country or countries. Sending masks and protective material to Wuhan at the start of the outbreak is an example of the measures taken in such cases.\nBut when it passes into a pandemic, all countries are considered infected, so everyone should look within their own borders and try to work on healing or resolving the disease more than prevention. International organisations such as the WHO or the United Nations are obliged to divide resources around the world, which means new difficulties, the need for more people, more money, more capacity for supplies to fight the disease.\n\"We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus\", warns the WHO, who claims to be totally focused on combat since the first patient was diagnosed. \"81 countries did not report any case of Covid-19 and 57 countries reported ten or less. We cannot say this loud enough or clearly enough or frequently enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic.\"\nCurrently, worldwide there are records of 121.564 confirmed cases of infection; There are four.373 confirmed deaths (3.046 in China) and 66.239 people already recovered.\nPortugal should enter the so-called mitigation phase within the next few hours, which is characterized by local transmission in a closed environment and community transmission. This is the last phase of response.\n", "label": 1, "id": 2198}, {"content": "Asian Insider, Jan 28: Wuhan alarm, Davos takeaways, China-Taiwan relations.

Our sign-up page is here. \n  \n As individuals prepared to return to their offices after the long weekend to celebrate Chinese New year, China and several other countries were scrambling to prevent infections from spreading. The death toll was estimated at 106 in China while state newspaper People's Daily estimated the number of confirmed cases at 4,515. Experts believe the number could be higher.\u00a0 \n Here's what we know: \n Measures to contain the spread: China has delayed the start of the spring semester for schools and universities, after the Lunar New Year, urging\u00a0citizens to reconsider the timing of overseas travel to reduce cross-border movement. \n Quest for medical remedies: China has sent nearly 6,000 medical workers from across the country to Hubei Province, to deal with cases as they emerge. Meanwhile, Chinese researchers have selected 30 existing drugs, biologically active natural products and traditional Chinese medicines which may have therapeutic effects on the novel coronavirus for further tests. \n Wuhan virus links in region: Cases linked to people who travelled from Wuhan have been confirmed in a dozen countries, from Japan to the United States, where authorities said they had 110 people under investigation in 26 states. Sri Lanka was the latest to confirm a case, while Thailand on Tuesday confirmed six more cases among visitors from China, bringing the country\u2019s total to 14 cases. \n Update from Singapore: Two new cases of Wuhan virus have been confirmed in Singapore, bringing the total number of infected people here to seven, the Health Ministry said earlier today. With three confirmed cases within the last 24 hours, the trend of infection among Chinese nationals from Wuhan's Hubei province in Singapore is accelerating, said the ministry. This presents a heightened risk to Singapore, although there is at yet no evidence that the virus has spread in the community. \n In another report, our journalists Hariz Baharudin and Prisca Ang report that Singapore is trying hard to prevent the spread of fake news.\u00a0 \n How long will it last: The deadly new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, that has broken out in China will afflict a minimum of tens of thousands of people and will last at least several months, researchers estimate based on the first available data. \n Impact on economies, markets: The impact of the Wuhan virus outbreak on the Chinese economy should not be underestimated, given that the tragedy has hit the country at a time when it seems to be more vulnerable, writes Senior Correspondent Ovais Subhani. \n More reports:\u00a0 \n Wuhan virus: Key moments of the outbreak so far\u00a0 \n Wuhan virus: Get the latest updates \n  \n How has China handled the Wuhan virus outbreak?
